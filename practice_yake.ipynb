    "## Practice with YAKE! Keyword Extraction"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},

    "YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Yake! does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: My understanding is that YAKE! is meant to be run on a **single document as a string**. If you have multiple documents, you need to merge them into one single string before using YAKE! In other terms, YAKE! does not seem to take in a list of strings (strings separated by a comma) or a list of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! features to note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus-Independent:** YAKE! offers a solution which can retrieve keywords from a single document only, without the need to rely on external document collection statistics as IDF does; i.e., it can be applied to any text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Domain and Language-Independent:** YAKE! works with domains and languages for which there are no ready keyword extraction systems, as it neither requires a training corpus nor depends on sophisticated external sources (such as WordNet or Wikipedia) or linguistic tools (such as NER or PoS taggers) other than a static list of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interior Stopwords:** YAKE! can retrieve keywords containing interior stopwords (e.g., “game of Thrones”) with higher precision than the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale:** YAKE! scales to any document length linearly in the number of candidate terms identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency-free:** meaning that no conditions are set with respect to the minimum frequency or sentence frequency that a candidate keyword must have. Therefore, based on the features used, a keyword may be considered significant or insignificant with either one occurrence or with multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! has five main steps:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text pre-processing and candidate term identification.** The first step pre-processes the document into a machine-readable format in order to identify potential candidate terms.This is an important and crucial step to identify better candidate terms and thus to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction.** The second phase takes as input a list of individual terms and represents them by a set of statistical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing term score.** In the third step, these features are heuristically combined into a single score likely to reflect the importance of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **n-gram generation and computing candidate keyword score.** The fourth step then generates the candidate keywords (through an n-gram7 construction methodology) and assigns them scores, based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data deduplication and ranking.** Finally, the fifth step compares likely similar keywords through the application of a deduplication distance similarity measure. The list of final keywords is then sorted by their relevance scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",

institute all rights reserved section vol no length words byline faiza shafique and riffat sadiq body keywords aggression health women introduction aggression is an instinctive drive of a person and a dark side of human nature it includes a variety of range of behaviors aggression involves verbal and physical assault therefore its expression results in intense violence towards others aggression is an unwanted and maladaptive behavior causing damage and obliteration it is exhibited in different forms encompassing physical aggression verbal aggression anger and hostility a person with physical aggression causing physical and emotional harm others while harming or hurting someone verbally is described as verbal aggression anger involves physiological activation determining emotional and affective state hostility includes feelings of cynicism mistrust and opposition with regards to gender difference research demonstrated men to be more involved in physical violence in contrast women seemed to be more indulged in verbal aggression at times women exhibit passive anger substantial research data highlighted psychological and physical health problems with aggression it is allied with depression and increased heart rate in women anger is related to coronary heart disease while anger expression is connected to hypertension aggression is related to physical health symptoms such as back pain arthralgia headaches and peptic ulcer aggression is also harmful for social relationship with family and friends anger has negative influence on physical health of women it causes depression disturbs quality of life and creates interpersonal problems the present research intended to examine the aggression as a determinant of physical health in married women in asian culture women physical health is incumbent for family stability they are engaged in performing household responsibilities from dawn to dusk such as dusting cleaning cooking child rearing and taking care of husbands in laws this full time job is difficult to be performed adequately if women experience discomfort pain and feel incapable thus it is significant to address factors determining their physical health the present study attempted to probe how aggression may influence physical health of married women methodology having approval from the ethical review committee of affiliated institution the present correlational study was carried out from january to september snowball sampling method was employed to recruit one hundred and fifty n married women hailing from jinnah town lyallpur town madina town and jaranwala town situated in faisalabad women with chronic physical mental illnesses infertility and those experiencing domestic violence were excluded post hoc analysis to compute achieved power of sample n for multiple regression revealed the statistical power of present sample size with effect size of at level demographic information page of aggression and physical health in married women including age educational level marital status duration of marriage number of children and family members was taken with demographic information form dif urdu version of physical health a subscale of quality of life scale measured physical health of the participants in terms of daily activities dependence on medicine pain discomfort capacity to work and mobility it comprised of items there is a point of continuum for scoring all of its items reliability for urdu version was α aggression questionnaire items was used to examine aggression in women it comprised of four subscales physical aggression items verbal aggression items anger items and hostility with items there is point likert scale gor scoring aggression questionnaire was translated into urdu language by three experts having sound knowledge of psychology which was translated back into english by three bilingual experts seventh expert reviewed both translated and original version and sorted out appropriate translated urdu items to finalize the scale subsequently english original version was administered on a group of people and with days of interval translated version final draft was also administered on the same group finally correlation between english and urdu versions and internal consistency were computed to ensure the reliability of urdu version for the present study estimated cronbach s alpha for physical aggression was α of verbal aggression α of anger α hostility α and full scale was α correlation between english and urdu versions for the subscale of physical aggression was r verbal aggression r

were matriculate and were married for more than years among them belonged to joint family system table aggression significantly predicted physical health in married women β t p as shown in table significant association was found between aggression and physical health r about of variance r² in physical health was accounted for aggression furthermore adjusted r showed of variance in dependent variable due to independent variable δr² among four components of aggression physical aggression β t p and anger β t p were found to be more specific for prediction of physical health in married women table discussion aggression significantly determines physical health of married women previous studies have also noted significant association between aggression and physical health such as coronary heart diseases thus supporting the present findings by exemplifying the negative influence of trait displaced aggression on physical health consequences aggressive tendencies influence human physiology people who face aggression physiologically respond to stressful situation with high activation of sympatho adrenomedullary system that high activation of sympatho adrenomedullary system is responsible for disturbance in blood flow gastrointestinal and reproductive organs this might be one of the reasons aggression affecting physical health in women anger too significantly determined physical health in married women literature has demonstrated significant association of anger with diabetes and coronary heart problems more anger out or anger expression was robustly associated with health risk behaviors and poor physical health in this regard present findings could be justified while focusing on the emotions involved in anger a previous study illustrated the direct influence of emotional state on physical health with negative emotions an individual pessimistically perceive a problematic situation and easily gets frustrated conversely optimistic point of view promotes physical health rather than impeding the person s growth it was further revealed by other research evidence which proved optimism playing a significant predictive role in physical health hence women with anger and aggressiveness are preoccupied with negativity and pessimism leading to physical distress discomfort and pain two other components of aggression verbal aggression and hostility did not significantly determine physical health in married women verbal aggression in the present study was also measured in the form of arguments and disagreements women are usually found to be using verbal ability to express whatever they feel and think sometimes it results in verbal arguments disagreements and illogical discussions perhaps for this reason this variable might not be debilitating the physical health of women like physical aggression and anger did besides hostility comprised of feelings of mistrust and cynicism also women in the present study might not feel their relations and life as miserable and mistrusted that could badly affect their physical health conclusion verbal and physical aggression determines physical health of married women aggression cultivates negative emotions

institute all rights reserved section vol no length words byline faiza shafique and riffat sadiq body keywords aggression health women introduction aggression is an instinctive drive of a person and a dark side of human nature it includes a variety of range of behaviors aggression involves verbal and physical assault therefore its expression results in intense violence towards others aggression is an unwanted and maladaptive behavior causing damage and obliteration it is exhibited in different forms encompassing physical aggression verbal aggression anger and hostility a person with physical aggression causing physical and emotional harm others while harming or hurting someone verbally is described as verbal aggression anger involves physiological activation determining emotional and affective state hostility includes feelings of cynicism mistrust and opposition with regards to gender difference research demonstrated men to be more involved in physical violence in contrast women seemed to be more indulged in verbal aggression at times women exhibit passive anger substantial research data highlighted psychological and physical health problems with aggression it is allied with depression and increased heart rate in women anger is related to coronary heart disease while anger expression is connected to hypertension aggression is related to physical health symptoms such as back pain arthralgia headaches and peptic ulcer aggression is also harmful for social relationship with family and friends anger has negative influence on physical health of women it causes depression

health is incumbent for family stability they are engaged in performing household responsibilities from dawn to dusk such as dusting cleaning cooking child rearing and taking care of husbands in laws this full time job is difficult to be performed adequately if women experience discomfort pain and feel incapable thus it is significant to address factors determining their physical health the present study attempted to probe how aggression may influence physical health of married women methodology having approval from the ethical review committee of affiliated institution the present correlational study was carried out from january to september snowball sampling method was employed to recruit one hundred and fifty n married women hailing from jinnah town lyallpur town madina town

significant association was found between aggression and physical health r about of variance r² in physical health was accounted for aggression furthermore adjusted r showed of variance in dependent variable due to independent variable δr² among four components of aggression physical aggression β t p and anger β t p were found to be more specific for prediction of physical health in married women table discussion aggression significantly determines physical health of married women previous studies have also noted significant association between aggression and physical health such as coronary heart diseases thus supporting the present findings by exemplifying the negative influence of trait displaced aggression on physical health consequences aggressive tendencies influence human physiology people who face aggression physiologically respond to stressful situation with high activation of sympatho adrenomedullary system that high activation of sympatho adrenomedullary system is responsible for disturbance in blood flow gastrointestinal and reproductive organs this might be one of the reasons aggression affecting physical health in women anger too significantly determined physical health in married women literature has demonstrated significant association of anger with diabetes and coronary heart problems more anger out or anger expression was robustly associated with health risk behaviors and poor physical health in this regard present findings could be justified while focusing on the emotions involved in anger a previous study illustrated the direct influence of emotional state on physical health with negative emotions an individual pessimistically perceive a problematic situation and easily gets frustrated conversely optimistic point of view promotes physical health rather than impeding the person s growth it was further revealed by other research evidence which proved optimism playing a significant predictive role in physical health hence women with anger and aggressiveness are preoccupied with negativity and pessimism leading to physical distress discomfort and pain two other components of aggression verbal aggression and hostility did not significantly determine physical health in married women verbal aggression in the present study was also measured in the form of arguments and disagreements women are usually found to be using verbal ability to express whatever they feel and think sometimes it results in verbal arguments disagreements and illogical discussions perhaps for this reason this variable might not be debilitating the physical health of women like physical aggression and anger did besides hostility comprised of feelings of mistrust and cynicism also women in the present study might not feel their relations and life as miserable and mistrusted that could badly affect their physical health conclusion verbal and physical aggression determines physical health of married women aggression cultivates negative emotions

byline asad r nadeem m christopher m ahmed h awais f and majeed h a body keywords awareness smokers non smokers oral health introduction the global tobacco epidemic is one of the serious and major public health concerns it causes more than eight million people deaths around the world of these fatalities seven million deaths are occurring due to direct consumption of tobacco while million mortalities of non smokers are the result of passive smoke owing to tobacco consumption low and middle income countries are the most vulnerable countries contributing to the highest morbidity and mortality rates where currently billion i e of the world s smokers resides in addition to the harmful effects of tobacco on health productivity losses and health expenditures are significantly contributing to the overall economic burden of smoking which is estimated to be around us trillion per annum this burden is equivalent to the magnitude of of the global annual gross domestic product gdp developing countries are the main stakeholders of this burden as they borne of this overall economic cost pakistan is among top countries who carries a substantial weight of diseases associated with tobacco worldwide according to the who report established scale of smoking frequency unveiled of pakistan s adult population of men and of women utilizes tobacco in various forms of the tobacco prevalent population of the adult population of men and of women are regular cigarette smokers whereas of the adult population men and women are regular water pipe smokers furthermore men women and of adults practice smokeless tobacco every day as concerns youth population of boys of girls and of youth is consuming tobacco in multiple ways many fatal diseases including respiratory diseases lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are all directly associated with tobacco consumption similarly smoking is more likely to affect the oral well being in several ways emerging from nominal impacts e g teeth discoloring to plausibly hazardous conditions such as oral cancer other conditions include periodontal diseases diminished response to surgical as well as non surgical periodontal treatments pre cancerous lesions and dental transplant collapse the rapid increase in the use of tobacco in pakistan is alarming regardless of confirmed adverse impacts of smoking on health especially on oral wellbeing only few studies assess the awareness of dental patients in the context of pakistan furthermore the dearth of available literature elucidated oral diseases as a center of the research and few has analyzed other aspects of oral wellbeing therefore the objectives of this study were to assess the awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients and to explore the impact of sociodemographics on patient s awareness of these effects page of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics methods the survey was approved by the ethical review committee erc of the hussain college of health sciences hussain memorial hospital lahore no hcsc erc this analytical study was conducted for months between april and february in the six private dental clinics of lahore which is provincial capital of punjab pakistan all patients participated in this study provided written informed consent therefore all patients included in this survey were eighteen years of age or older and visiting for dental procedures in the private dental clinics however study excluded all those patients who did not provide written informed consent the minimum sample size needed to maintain a margin of error confidence interval was calculated as patients using a raosoft sample size calculator by using random sampling technique patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study targeted patients were interviewed by the trained data enumerators by using semi structured questionnaires questionnaire was developed by a multi disciplinary team of authors based on the past reliable and validated scales the survey instrument was pre tested on two groups of patients each to assess various aspects including presentation acceptability and ease of understanding the questionnaire consisted of thirteen questions and was further sub divided into two sections the section wise distribution of variables information is as follows i sociodemographic variables included six questions i e gender female male

compared to their female counterparts meager proportion of the respondents were unmarried of the patients educational background of the participants was relatively high and up to the university level education however smoker patients were from the same category nearly one fourth of the patients reported monthly household income below the level of pkr and patients had no rural background table scores calculated for the patient s awareness from where patients correctly identified effects of smoking on oral health followed by and effects there was a significant difference between non smokers and smokers according to rural background p educational level of the patients p and gender p but not in marital status or monthly household income table awareness level of dental patients visiting private clinics regarding the effects of tobacco consumption on oral heath according to their smoking status majority of the patients correctly identified oral cancers and caries as serious threat to

model fitness was highly significant p gender p educational background of the patients p and monthly household income p were significantly associated with the dental patient s awareness visiting private clinics table discussion smokers were least aware of the adverse impact of smoking on oral health than non smokers scores calculated for the level of awareness unveiled great variations among patients regarding the identification of adverse impacts on oral health triggered by smoking as most of the patients were only able to identify two or threeout of five effects moreover smoker versus non smoker patients were significantly different according to their education gender and rural background also awareness level for the different effects of smoking on oral health including periodontal health caries oral cancer and wound healing was significantly different in smokers versus non smokers furthermore socio demographic factors i e income education and gender were significantly impacting the patient s awareness in current study our results regarding patient s awareness related to negative impact of smoking on oral health among smokers were consistent from those reported by researchers in kuwait the study showed that only one fourth dental patients had full knowledge of these effects similarly dawood and colleagues also reported that smokers had lack of awareness for such effects including male impotency in smokers lung cancers in passive smokers it might be owing to the addiction to smoking which force the smokers to stick with the tobacco consumption irrespective of its hazardous effects on general health and oral wellbeing this justification may also be related to the government of pakistan s initiative which has ensured the compliance of cigarette manufacturers to mention the cautions of smoking hazards on each page of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics and every pack of cigarette in written and pictorial form on the contrary a non smoker perspective may also be inferred which indicates that lack of smoking is directly associated with the awareness of smoking hazards another reason may also be supplemented according to which non smokers being well aware of smoking effects intends to avoid such addictions so they may not encountered with fatal diseases consistent with our work bhatti and colleagues showed that none of the female patients were consuming tobacco in any form as compare to their male counterparts another study elucidated that female as compare to male patients were taking good care of themselves in chronic ill health conditions which shows the female s priority to maintain their health and well being another reason might be linked which explained the gender differences for tobacco consumption is due to the cultural restrictions where such practices consider as unpleasant especially for women contrary to our results a us based study reported that prevalence of smoking among university graduates was less as compared to those having education up to high school level in consistent its present study results sociodemographics including education gender and income were associated with the awareness level of patients regarding smoking hazards to oral health study further showed that females as well as people having higher level of education and higher income were more likely to be aware of such hazards according to a who report smoking is directly linked with the low socioeconomic communities people with low income tend to smoke more than their affluent counterpart and smoking worsened the level of poverty nevertheless our study results didn t support such associations but consistent to saudi study which showed that individuals from affluent families were more likely to smoke cigarettes as compare to those with low socioeconomic backgrounds the argument of economic disadvantage deems to provide an explanation that having lower probability of smoking among unprivileged individuals might be owing to their unaffordability to purchase cigarettes than people from higher income class it is concluded that in a nutshell smoker patients are least aware of the harmful effects of smoking on oral health than non smokers patient awareness concerning such effects is affected by various sociodemographics therefore there is a dire need of further comparative studies involving public healthcare facilities to ensure the validity of inferences drawn from this study limitations the study was self funded and has limited resources in future study may be conducted on large scale to strengthen its reliability of conclusions drawn about study topic under discussion

important determinant of individual health status which held the individual responsible for his own health health promotion behaviors are directed toward achieving a higher level of wellness personal fulfillment and self actualization health related behaviors in young age are important factor that affects the individual risk for non communicable diseases and other disorders later in life it is evident that promoting healthy lifestyle behaviors among university students is essential to decrease disease risk later in adulthood thus it is important to investigate their health promoting behaviors therefore this research was conducted to determine the level of nursing university student s engagement in health promoting behaviors and its association with socio demographic factors keywords health promotion healthy lifestyle quality of life health outcome introduction a health promoting lifestyle is a pattern of self initiated actions which individuals take to control maintain or enhance their own health lifestyle patterns have significant effects on long term morbidity and mortality that is becoming increasingly evident many studies have demonstrated that healthy lifestyles not only promote health but also can mitigate the negative effects of chronic disease and decrease the incidence of various health conditions consequently encouraging a healthy lifestyle is crucial in terms of potentially preventing the development of chronic diseases reducing morbidity improving the quality of life qol and decreasing medical costs and the healthcare burden on society the who defines qol as individuals perception of their position in life in the context of the culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals expectations standards and concerns it is a broad ranging concept which encompasses a person s physical and psychological state level of independence and social relationships however the association between healthy lifestyles and qol has been the subject of relatively few studies and these have focused mainly on disease populations in one earlier study on the relationship between healthy lifestyle and qol the authors found that positive psychosocial behavior positive health practices and exercise and physical recreation were all significantly related to perceived health and well page of health promoting factors related to lifestyle among nursing students in university of hail being health outcome appraisals is a vital part of qol and an understanding of the relationship between healthy lifestyle and qol would have important implications for the design of health promotion programs to improve the overall qol of the general public university students are going through transitional period from childhood to adulthood characterized by physical psychological social and sexual development promoting healthy behaviors during this period increase their chance to be healthy adults in the future although the benefits of health promoting behaviors are well known many studies revealed that university students have unhealthy lifestyle such as physical inactivity which needs further attention methods design

prohibition of car use as well as by soft measures e g travel planning subsidies marketing rewards and discounts to encourage citizens to reconsider their travel choices recently it has become a common objective of transport authorities to reduce car use through the use of soft measure in the form of positive interventions in this study we present results of a study in the use of positive interventions to promote sustainable travel behaviours specifically cycling table lists several case studies in which such incentives were employed to promote cycling table overview of behavioural

effective for traveller s intention behaviour change second one is on the contrary stated preference survey as table shows tangible rewards such as money and in kind gifts are often used to promote cycling together with information that may motivate travellers to change their behaviour such as feedback on past behaviour setting of goals and planning behaviour change and comparing their behaviour with that of others in addition at least three reviews have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of such interventions on cycling nearly all showed positive effects page of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work the majority of studies which focused on positive interventions in table analysed interventions in field experiments most of them are general interventions that are the same for everyone not personalised based on historic behaviour and personal needs this is not the case for travel behaviour change schemes such as described by wen et al and used in the travelsmart project which provide personalised travel plans and feedback by phone call interview and showed that individualised marketing of interventions helps change travel behaviour in an effective way however such programs are quite labour intensive and therefore difficult to scale up to large numbers of participants this may be changing though with the aid of smartphone apps that can automatically detect travel behaviour and provide rewards accordingly such as strava fietstelweek cyclemaps and betterpoints however so far only used smartphone apps to study the effects of positive incentives on cycling in a field study similar studies that did not focus on cycling have proven that interventions through mobile technologies can successfully stimulate sustainable travel behaviour e g although field experiments with smartphones can measure behaviour change they also have some drawbacks they require a lot of commitment from participants as a result samples are relatively small at most a few hundred respondents and are probably biased due to self selection i e participants who are already willing to cycle are more likely to participate moreover external factors such as weather and events have a strong influence on cycling demand these factors interfere with the positive incentives control groups can be used to determine the external effects in this type of experiment the use of control groups is however quite hard only one study has participants in a control group because there is little incentive for people to participate i e there is a burden of using the app but no benefits in the form of positive incentives such as rewards due to these drawbacks it is difficult to make comparisons between incentives or between segments of the population only the travelsmart project made such comparisons comparisons between studies are even harder for example ryley found that a financial incentive of per day would not induce or increase cycle commuting while wardman et al argued that an incentive of per day can almost double the amount of cycling it is not clear whether these differences are real or the result of the aforementioned selection and or external effects furthermore according to some studies in kind gifts can be a good alternative to money however shaffer and arkes concluded that this is only the case when money and in kind gifts are not offered simultaneously because a direct comparison between non cash and cash incentives makes the fungibility of the cash reward more visible this study tries to overcome these issues by designing a controlled experiment using a stated intention survey with multiple incentives respondents got a neutral invitation to participate in a smart mobility experiment without mentioning cycling and the respondents burden is limited as a result we obtain a relatively large sample and we reduce the self selection bias to make the experiment as realistic as possible we used mock up apps with which participants could interact as with a real app and we personalised the incentives by including actual travel behaviour of the participants in doing so we can compare incentives and test which one may be most successful overall we think that people who never cycle non cyclists may need other incentives to start cycling than people who already cycle but could still cycle more occasional cyclists we also expect differences between young and older people between highly and lowly educated people and between males and females with the former groups probably more likely to cycle more when positive incentives are provided in this study we test these assumptions with segmentation analyses that are mostly lacking in other studies the

design in order to investigate the effect of different reward schemes delivered through smartphone technologies we designed five intervention schemes based on the work of zhang et al and ben elia and ettema we included travel context travellers attitudes and demographics as discriminating factors between groups fig summarises the research framework including the interventions we distinguished between respondents who never cycle non cyclist group ncg respondents who cycle occasionally occasional cyclist group ocg and respondents who cycle daily daily cyclist group dcg this was done as e g oinas kukkonen and harjumaa and khaled et al argued that incentives can be more effective when they relate to the actual behaviour of the user fig research framework table lists the five intervention schemes built on principles with a high potential according to our literature studies such as goals feedback and rewards according to goal setting theory goals and planning feedback and motioning and rewards give the best results when they are combined the types of rewards however were different in the various studies such as cash rewards in kind gifts and praise with this in mind we composed our first three intervention schemes based on cash rewards in kind gifts and praise furthermore a study by landers et al concluded that presenting specific goals on a leaderboard can have a similar effect as traditional goal setting and dubuy et al showed that this also applies for the promotion of cycling we therefore used individual tasks combined with feedback self monitoring rewards and social influence in intervention schemes and in scheme we tested the potential of competition individual goal whereas in scheme we investigated the potential of cooperation collective goal table incentive

considered in the analysis if there were n dichotomous variables n variables were used for each category to prevent multicollinearity for example with the gender category the reference used was male and the estimate for female was analysed relative to the male reference variable coefficients were estimated for a large number of variables attributes for which the coefficients had p values were included in the final model if an attribute was included in one model we also included it in the other models to make a fair comparison possible the coefficients of the utility functions can be

less sensitive to self selection than field experiments there is no evidence of self selection among employees for example modal shares for the university of twente sample were comparable to that of a general travel survey among university employees a few years earlier however there probably is a self selection of employers our sample also has a higher fraction of highly educated and high income respondents compared to the dutch travel survey we suspect that this type of study attracts employers whose workforce is more highly educated even though this study has statistically enough data for most segments and the model is used to identify the impact of various incentives we should take this into consideration when applying the results to the whole population participants were randomly assigned to one of the five mock ups based on their commuting frequency by bicycle participants who never or only occasionally cycled to work were randomly assigned to one of the intervention schemes see table participants who always cycled to work were randomly assigned to intervention scheme or participants who always cycle to work do not need to improve their frequency of cycling commute and therefore were not offered the chance to interact with the remaining intervention schemes table summarises the number of respondents randomly assigned to one of our rewarding schemes based on travel

participants could interact e g by clicking on the smartphone screen with the mock up as if it was a real smartphone app moreover this part was designed to be personalised when participants clicked to join the challenge the challenge was related to their commuting distance and frequency of cycling to work the content of the challenges directly related to the cycling frequency to be increased participants could choose a challenge they thought was suitable for them and receive a corresponding reward based on the level of the challenge and the commuting distance the amount of the rewards was based on a real budget for cycling promotion derived from an analysis of an existing local scheme page of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work after interacting with the mock ups the respondents were asked whether they would feel motivated to cycle more to work based on the personalised schemes offered to them they were also asked whether they would consider using the app in real life additionally we also asked the respondents opinions about other interventions since they could only interact with one mock up those questions are vital for intervention effectiveness checking because it reflects the respondents stated preference of behaviour change by the provided interventions the final part contained personal information related to the socioeconomic status of the respondents such as gender age annual income education and nationality results section presents the model estimation regarding app usage and a potential increase in cycling we mainly discuss statistically significant results i e using a significance level of p and explicitly mention it when differences are not statistically significant tables contain the model results in section we discuss the model estimation results for the choice between different incentives see table app usage and cycling motivation result as explained in section we used reference categories and estimated the utility of the other categories with respect to the reference in general we used the first or last variable in a category as the reference for example the highest age and highest income categories serve as references for the incentive variable we used the in kind gifts category as a reference as in kind gifts have been shown to be a relatively good incentive to change behaviour the model results see tables show that the probability of using the app app case is significantly lower for the competition p and money mock ups p in the ncg and significantly lower for the cooperation mock up p in the ocg however in the other cases there is not enough evidence to claim that the in kind gifts mock up scores significantly better the left panel of fig displays the fraction of respondents who are willing to use the app but from fig it does not become immediately clear that the differences are significant the reason for this is that there are actually three categories respondents could indicate that they would or would not consider using the app but they could also indicate that they did not know whether they would use the app in the future the percentage of respondents with inconclusive responses is more or less the same for the different incentive schemes i e about for the non cyclists and about for the occasional cyclists the model used the not considering category as a reference as it is a logical choice for a baseline and the results are significant relative to this not considering category in the ocg neither the cooperation nor the competition mock up attracted a significant fraction of potential app users fig interventions statistics of app case and cycle case for ncg and ocg with the error bars indicating the one sigma error regarding segmentation we find that respondents who already used related apps are more likely to use the app provided to them p the difference between the ncg and ocg is that non cyclists with short commutes who care about travel costs and safety are more likely to consider using the app p and as expected younger and higher educated travellers are more likely to use the new app however only respondents in the ocg confirm this hypothesis with statistical significance it appears that non cyclists tend to use the app for reasons related to travel situations such as saving on costs and improving safety whereas socio demographic attributes are main drivers for occasional cyclists finally foreign and low income respondents who cycle daily are inclined to consider using the app p and regarding the latter group this may be attributed to the fact that they are more economically vulnerable and therefore more open to tangible rewards page of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work with regard to respondents indicating that they would be motivated to cycle more cycle case the competition mock up p scores worse in the ncg but there is no evidence that other mock up scores are worse than the in kind gift mock up this is illustrated by the right panel in fig which shows the percentage of respondents who indicate that they would be motivated to cycle more in response to the given incentive that the competition mock up scores low is not strange since non cyclists are not likely to win a prize in a competition however the daily cyclists also tend to show a preference for the cooperation mock up over the competition mock up this is somewhat surprising as we expected people who cycle daily to be more motivated to be directly compared with their peers competition in the ocg all mock ups except the money mock up score worse than the in kind gift mock up p these results suggest that tangible rewards are most likely to motivate people to cycle more as there appears to be a slight but non significant preference for in kind gifts over money regarding segmentation both non cyclists and occasional cyclists who care about travel costs are more likely to be motivated to cycle more however travel costs seem to be less important for occasional cyclists than for people who never cycle specifically for the non cyclists respondents with short commutes are more inclined to be motivated to cycle more when they are rewarded p this is in line with dubuy et al who showed that the effect of interventions declined with increasing commute distance for the occasional cyclists respondents who care about travelling in a relaxed way p or care about travel safety p and are younger and have low incomes p are more inclined to be motivated to cycle more in contrast to the non cyclists commute distance does not seem to play an important role here for people who never cycle hard attributes such as travel costs and distance appear to be main drivers to get people onto the bicycle for the occasional cyclists who already have some cycling experience attributes related to the cycling itself such as safety and whether the trip is relaxed and socio demographic attributes appear to be more important drivers to motivate them to cycle more for the respondents who cycle daily we find that foreigners p young people and people who use similar apps p tend to be more motivated to cycle more talking about cycling also has a positive impact on cycling motivation p incentive preferences model analysis as table shows we also asked people directly which reward scheme they would prefer including the ones they were not introduced to incentive case most people preferred the money incentive followed by the in kind gift incentive and no rewards at all therefore we focused on comparing those three incentives fig shows that money and in kind gifts are the most preferable schemes for all groups except that for the non cyclists no reward at all appears to be the most preferred option contrary to what we see in the app case and cycle case i e where people got to see one mock up app money incentives score significantly better than in kind gifts for the ncg and ocg the difference between the two schemes is particularly large for the ncg although this result appears to contradict the results from the mock up app questions it is important to stress that a mock up app is not the same as the reward itself the in kind mock up also provides a web based shop which contributes to the fun factor this can be seen as a double reward as after gaining points you will also be able to shop with your points however when offered as an alternative to money the comparison makes the fungibility of the money reward more visible this is in line with results from gneezy et al and shaffer and arkes comparing no rewards with money or in kind gift incentives the results of table show that the respondents attitude towards cycling has an impact on their preference respondents who were negative about cycling were inclined to choose no rewards also non cyclists p and respondents who did not care about travel costs p tended to choose no reward this implies that behaviour change among non cyclists with a negative attitude towards cycling is difficult which is not surprising making them aware of the travel costs of their current travel mode can be a way to motivate them to change their behaviour respondents with higher education tend to prefer rewards instead of no rewards p this is somewhat unexpected as we expected highly educated people to be less sensitive to tangible rewards maybe they opt for a tangible reward instead of no reward because they are more likely to use the corresponding app see the previous subsection page of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work fig incentive preferences statistics with the error bars indicating the one sigma error the respondents who choose money or in kind gift instead of no rewards tend to be female p young p care about travel time and travel costs p and and have a low income p interestingly females are more inclined to choose in kind gifts p whereas males opt for money the latter was also found by steven and avineri and dickinson et al although gamification competition or cooperation was not preferred in general we can distinguish some groups in this regard respondents with a positive attitude towards cycling with short commute distances and or respondents who care about the environment have a higher probability of choosing the gamification incentives male respondents are also more likely to choose gamification over in kind gifts while respondents who care about travel costs talk often about cycling and or have a high education level are more likely to choose gamification rather than no reward it seems that these latter groups are more open to any incentive scheme from the respondents intention about cycling behaviour change we can see that respondents who are negative about the mock up mostly choose another scheme in the general question while respondents who are positive about the mock scheme tend to stick with this scheme however there is one notable exception a significant fraction of respondents who are positive about the in kind gift mock up prefers a social reward scheme and vice versa this result suggests that in kind and social reward schemes are attractive to the same type of respondent in contrast there is almost no exchange between in kind gifts and money which suggests that these two schemes attract different types of people conclusions in this study we have examined the potential impact of five positive incentive schemes i e social rewards in kind gifts monetary rewards cooperation and competition on commuters cycling behaviour and intention to accept a commuting app we conducted a study in which these incentive schemes were delivered through a smartphone mock up app as part of a stated preference survey intervention schemes on the basis of goal setting feedback and rewards had a positive effect on cycling motivation and potential app usage occasional cyclists were clearly more positive towards the various incentive schemes with about considering one of the mock up schemes than non cyclists with about considering one of the mock up schemes for the individual schemes in kind gifts and money tangible rewards were most likely to motivate people to cycle more and use the corresponding app money was the most preferred incentive when respondents chose between alternative incentives but in kind gifts scored better when the mock up apps were considered separately the latter is in line with the findings of shaffer and arkes but having a web shop associated with in kind gifts may also have made people more enthusiastic about the in kind gift mock up than about the money mock up we therefore suggest that in kind incentives may be better for cycling promotion as in reality the incentive app will probably provide only one type of reward and the impersonal character of money may partly demotivate e g gneezy et al and shaffer and arkes however the picture is more nuanced as there are differences among the demographic groups for example men appeared more likely than women to opt for money travellers who had experiences with related apps tended to consider using the app for the non cyclists travel related attributes such as travel costs and distance appeared to be important for considering the app for occasional cyclists and daily cyclists socio demographic and socio economic attributes appeared to be more important specifically younger and higher educated occasional cyclists and foreign and low income daily cyclists were more likely to use the new app these results are quite in line what can be expected and also confirm results reported by chorus et al page of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work finally our results suggest that positive incentives may encourage non cyclists to start cycling if distances are short and travel costs are an important consideration in their travel choices by contrast when non cyclists do not care about travel costs they are most likely to choose no reward when asked directly in other words non cyclists may be encouraged to start cycling when they are made more aware of the travel cost benefits although this may only be true for low income groups while the attitude towards hard attributes such as travel costs are an important discriminator for behaviour change among non cyclists this is less true for occasional cyclists they are more likely to change behaviour if they care about attributes related to cycling itself such as safety and whether the cycling is relaxed which is not surprising as they already have experienced cycling however these are important pre conditions for encouraging cycling along with that line it is interesting to focus on weather in a future study bad weather is an important barrier for cycling among occasional cyclists does the fact that this attribute is important for occasional cyclists to make it more likely for them to change behaviour when they receive incentives or not this is an important question which we can only test in real world situations regarding the meaningfulness of the observed results one should be careful with drawing conclusions given the study context respondents were asked about their intentions and did not experience real cycling challenges inconsistencies between lab and field experiments have been reported in the literature especially when social preferences are involved see list and levitt for an overview nonetheless even in cases where revealed and stated intention results are not exactly the same some studies e g find a clear relation between the two suggesting that relative comparisons within a study are still valid moreover inconsistencies between lab and field experiments may also be caused by the fact that the context of the stated intention survey does not match the real world context in this study we simulate the reality as much as possible using mock up apps we show that this is important e g when comparing in kind gifts with money throughout the study we compared results with field experiments in the literature most of the results are in line with the literature however as mentioned in the introduction comparisons between incentives and segments are rare in field studies although we cannot be sure about the absolute effects in a real world implementation this study provides valuable insight by comparing the potential effects of different incentives on different segments in that sense the use of mock up apps can be viewed as complementary to field studies various features can be tested and the most popular and or effective ones can be implemented in a real app and tested in a field study the next step in this research will therefore be to implement the most successful incentive schemes in real world conditions within the empower project we have planned field experiments to do this and see whether the results from this study will be confirmed bibliography references european

mir tahir hussain talpur muhammad tauqeer katbar khalil ullah shabir kashif ullah shabir uzair yaqoob shah jabeen and danish zia body key words dyslipidemia hyperlipidemia ldl hdl triglyceride young adults introduction the term dyslipidemia signifies abnormal lipid or fat content in the blood including triglycerides phospholipids cholesterol lipoprotein and other fats lipoproteinemia denotes fatty substances that circulate in the blood attached with proteins and when they exceed the normal level it is called hyperlipoproteinemia similarly when cholesterol or triglycerides are increased the term given to this condition is hypercholesterolemia and hypertriglyceridemia respectively non optimal levels of low density lipoprotein ldl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol in young adults are independently associated with coronary atherosclerosis two decades later the causes of hyperlipidemia are multiple that includes genetic factors as in certain cases of familial hyperlipidemia besides other factors like cigarette smoking alcohol hypothyroidism chronic kidney disease obesity medications and dietary influences may also alter plasma lipid level plasma lipid levels are linked with normal functioning of heart brain and kidneys when present in normal range and when they become high health implications of atherosclerosis heart disease stroke and pancreatitis may occur one study done on hispanics that compared the old and young people presenting with acute myocardial infarction ami and to whom percutaneous coronary intervention was done it was concluded that high triglyceride level was the reason behind acute myocardial infarction another study was done in young adults of assam to determine the serum total cholesterol tc level in blood and association of that cholesterol level with body mass index bmi concluded that young adults especially who are overweight should be advised routine cholesterol testing so that preventive measures can be adopted to avoid hypercholesterolemia and its complications in future life in a study done in chongqing china to estimate the frequency and risk factors of dyslipidemia residents aged years were selected they found prevalence of dyslipidemia among men and among women out of these participants of the participants had isolated hypertriglyceridemia had isolated hypercholesterolemia had mixed hyperlipidemia and had isolated low hdl cholesterol the age group in males having the most cases of dyslipidemia was of years in a nutshell they advised conducting proper intervention programs for reducing risk factors and routine screening programs to check for blood lipid levels another study conducted in three states of india where young people age greater than years were selected had raised cholesterol level had decreased hdl had raised ldl had hypertriglyceridemia and had abnormalities in one of the lipid parameters this is a huge percentage that was page of prevalence of dyslipidemia in young adults observed during this study the high prevalence rate of dyslipidemia in states of india called for urgent lifestyle intervention strategies so that preventive measures are taken at a larger scale nowadays undiagnosed underlying dyslipidemia is the most common cause of mortality and morbidity in young adults and that s because of atherosclerotic related changes leading to stroke myocardial infarction hypertension and other metabolic syndromes although several studies have been done worldwide there is variability in those publications assuming the high lipid levels in our population similar to what we found in literature the results of this study will help us to understand what lipid profile is normally present in our population if abnormal timely screening education and proper management can be done stress should be given in national health care policies to prevent in order to prevent the hazards of stroke myocardial infarction and metabolic syndrome because of dyslipidemia material and methods this is a descriptive cross sectional study conducted in the outpatient department of medicine jinnah postgraduate medical centre karachi pakistan from november to april both male and female young adults defined in this study as those aged years after taking informed consent were included in the study pregnant women patients with diagnosed liver diseases familial hyperlipidemias diabetes hypertension nephrotic syndrome and those using any lipid lowering agents like statins were excluded from the study those not willing to participate were also excluded patients were gathered in the assigned duration limited information was collected i e their age gender and the parameters of their fasting lipid profile including total cholesterol triglycerides hdl and ldl cholesterol for the lipid profile intravenous blood samples were collected in testing bottles containing an anticoagulant agent after overnight fasting of hours and sent to the institutional laboratory for testing by an automated spectrophotometer and enzymatic colorimetric method according to the guidelines of national committee for clinical laboratory standards dyslipidemia was defined according to the national cholesterol education project ncep adult treatment panel iii as abnormal levels of any of the following components of the lipid profile tc of less than mg dl was considered desirable while that of mg dl was termed as hypercholesterolemia hdl was considered as low when it was mg dl while ldl was considered as optimal when it was less than mg dl triglycerides level mg dl was identified as hypertriglyceridemia we defined isolated dyslipidemias as abnormal levels of any one of these factors however mixed dyslipidemia was the term given to abnormalities in more than one of these although borderline levels are alarming we did not consider those in the classification of hyperlipidemias the statistical analysis was performed using spss version mean and standard deviations were recorded for age and the lipid profile parameters the data were further categorized according to age group post stratification chi square and student t test was applied p value was considered significant results in this short study population of we had males and females we only gathered participants of age less than years and greater than years with a mean age of years in this study we found that of young adults had dyslipidemia we first distributed the population according to categories of lipid levels made by the ncep adult treatment panel iii which placed of the participants in the serum cholesterol range of mg dl desirable low and in that of mg dl high when triglyceride levels were analyzed had it equal or above the critical level of participants assigned to the study had hdl levels mg dl while four of them had it above mg dl on the other hand on grouping ldl levels we had of population with ldl levels mg dl in a range of mg dl

isolated low hdl levels and had mixed hyperlipidemia with significant differences between males and females in the former two discussion dyslipidemia has become a major public health concern its prevalence is rising at a steady pace particularly in developing countries the increasing prevalence of dyslipidemia is associated with several factors of which many are modifiable and are dependent on socioeconomic cultural and ethnic characteristics changes in lifestyle and diet contribute to a significant portion of risk factors associated with dyslipidemia risk factors for dyslipidemia are lack of physical page of prevalence of dyslipidemia in young adults activity obesity particularly central obesity metabolic syndrome hypertension old age and a diet rich in saturated fats and cholesterol dyslipidemia can be effectively controlled by pharmacological intervention but more importantly through dietary and lifestyle modification unfortunately lack of awareness and appropriate therapeutic intervention and management are emerging as barriers in preventing complications related to dyslipidemia dyslipidemia is a major pathogenic risk factor for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease cvd various cardiovascular incidents reported are all associated with uncontrolled dyslipidemia surveys conducted in china showed that the incidence of ischemic cvd is significantly reduced by controlling lipid profile among individuals therefore decreasing the mortality and morbidity associated with it the asymptomatic nature of dyslipidemia is also a concerning issue hence early screening and preventive measures are equally important in controlling it a national health and nutrition examination survey was conducted in the united states u s from through in which the proportion of the u s population with abnormalities in the lipid profile was assessed in this study it was stated by toth et al that about percent of u s adults have at least one lipid abnormality a similar survey that took place in china reported that approximately percent of the chinese population was found to have dyslipidemia these studies reflected the threat dyslipidemia pose on the general health of the population in our study we have succeeded to show that approximately of young adults had dyslipidemia which is significantly greater than the prevalence described in the above countries the prevalence of dyslipidemia increases with age however it is essential to note that it also affects younger adults moreover the process of atherosclerosis starts early in life a compilation of various observations made by the bogalusa heart study established an association between coronary atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors in young people among which serum ldl and serum triglyceride concentration were a significant factor along with many others therefore young adults with abnormal levels of lipids are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as coronary heart disease later in life considering the lack of literature on dyslipidemias in young adults and its importance in early detection of cardiovascular risks we have highlighted the significance of identifying dyslipidemia in young adults our study showed that the prevalence of dyslipidemia is higher in females as compared to males our result is coherent with a cross sectional survey conducted in chongqing china in this study the prevalence of dyslipidemia in women was as compared to in men this was primarily due to differences in the frequency of overweight obesity and central obesity in a study conducted in iran the incidence of dyslipidemia was for males and for females and therefore higher in females which is consistent with the result of our study however a vast literature provides evidence that the prevalence of dyslipidemia is much higher in men as compared to women this was shown by a cross sectional study by pan et al in which the incidence of dyslipidemia was higher in males than in females vs likewise in the chinese national nutrition and health survey concluded the prevalence of dyslipidemia in chinese adults as and in males and females respectively moreover a systemic review on dyslipidemia in chinese adults published between and stated that dyslipidemia was more common in men than in women prior researches have well established that abnormal lipid profile is more prevalent in men as compared to women this could be due to a higher frequency of cigarette smoking and more consumption of alcohol and high cholesterol food in men the prevalence of isolated hypercholesterolemia isolated hypertriglyceridemia and isolated low hdl cholesterol in the total population of our study was and respectively in the study conducted by pan et al this prevalence was and respectively extensive surveys in china organized from to revealed that low hdl c and hypertriglyceridemia were the two major types of dyslipidemia in chinese adults these findings were reinforced in a meta analysis by huang et al however these trends are different in western countries where high cholesterol and high ldl c were more common forms of dyslipidemia page of prevalence of dyslipidemia in young adults this was largely due to a high dietary fat and cholesterol intake in american residents furthermore according to our study isolated low hdl was higher in females as compared to males whereas isolated hypertriglyceridemia was higher in males than females the results are consistent with the korean national health and nutrition survey in which the large difference in hdl c across six countries was secondary to smoking alcohol consumption age fat intake bmi and educational level gender difference in hdl c is partly explained by high levels of estrogen in women this explains the lower mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases in the female gender hence hdl c is believed to be protective the early detection of dyslipidemia is important for implementing management strategies these strategies can in return reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases that may manifest later in life certain lifestyle modifications and lipid lowering drugs can be effective on individuals with abnormal lipid profiles however literature regarding the benefits of early screening and initiation of treatment is sparse a systematic review in the united states by chou et al stated that there was no prior study that could provide strong evidence for the effects of screening or treatment on clinical outcomes in younger adults moreover the benefit of early treatment was not clear therefore trials conducted on a big scale are needed to find evidence for the benefits and harms of dyslipidemia screening or treatment in younger adults there are some limitations to this study first being that this is a cross sectional study with no causal associations between any of the variables secondly this survey is limited by a small sample size and data collection in a single tertiary care setup another restriction was that the potential risk factors of dyslipidemia were not taken into consideration conclusion dyslipidemia being a major risk factor for many systemic diseases should be detected early in life so that effective management is carried out before the start of actual manifestations this study gave a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in asymptomatic young adults with females being more frequently affected than females references ahmed sm clasen me donnelly je management of dyslipidemia in adults am fam physician may

up to of myocardial infarctions in india occur in individuals younger than years of age body advanced practice clinicians need to be aware of the high rates of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd in the south asian population the most common cause of noncommunicable disease death worldwide is due to ascvd and ascvd is a key driver of health disparities globally of the ascvd burden occurs in low and middle income countries south asia is the fastest growing region in the world the south asian population defined as those living in india nepal maldives bhutan afghanistan pakistan sri lanka and bangladesh constitute of the world s population people from these countries are at particular risk for ascvd within the next years india is projected to become the most populous nation on earth south asians have a greater prevalence of ascvd than other ethnic groups and have disproportionately poorer health outcomes overall compared with other ethnic groups of the population is more likely to die from coronary heart disease compared with those of european origin hmicms ad it is important to note there are established differences in morbidity and mortality among different ethnic groups within the south asian population however ascvd death occurs to years earlier in all south asian populations compared with western populations although ascvd rates in the united states and other developed countries have decreased by half in the past years the rates in south asians have doubled in the past years the explanation for this increase in ascvd may arise from complex interactions between genetic and environmental factors south asians exhibit the highest rates of ascvd among all ethnic groups and the highest prevalence in this disparity is seen in younger age groups up to of myocardial infarctions in india occur in individuals under the age of compared with to of individuals in western europe and north america it is page of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the south asian population projected that within the next years south asians will account for of ascvd deaths worldwide this results in the highest loss of potentially productive years of life due to ascvd many risk factors are strongly linked to the development of ascvd including elevated blood glucose obesity smoking elevated blood pressure abnormal cholesterol levels and a positive family history of ascvd however these factors do not fully explain the disproportionately high ascvd risk within the south asian population this residual risk suggests that additional nonclassic risk factors contribute to ascvd risk hmicms related articles attempting to reduce the excess morbidity and mortality of ascvd requires a wide understanding of the collective risk factors associated with the disease state to facilitate treatment and attempt a reduction of risk across a population however population specific risk factors among the south asian population have been inadequately explored leading to a significant gap in the ability to understand ascvd risk factors within this population the increasing global ascvd burden in developing countries and the increasing cost of health care on local economies are cause for concern in addition to the risk of heart disease other health issues exist specifically in south asian populations they are to times more likely to have type diabetes than whites have a faster progression of disease be diagnosed at a younger age and have more complications genetic risk factors cholesterol dyslipidemia is well documented as one of the main risk factors of ascvd the effects of hypertriglyceridemia hyperglycemia and increased free fatty acid levels both fasting and postprandial on endothelial dysfunction may be mediated through oxidative stress although dyslipidemia does not occur at a higher rate in south asians the type of dyslipidemia does differ when compared with chinese and european populations south asians have higher total cholesterol low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglyceride levels and lower high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels south asians also have genetic polymorphisms causing higher levels of elevated lipoprotein a and defective apolipoprotein b both of these polymorphisms are independently and highly correlated with the presence and severity of ascvd hmicms ad hypertension south asians have upregulated angiotensin converting enzyme ace activity that is directly correlated with the development of hypertension das et al describe polymorphism of the ace gene in adult asians as a probable genetic risk factor for developing hypertension a replication study and meta analysis of japanese adults with hypertension confirmed the relationship of the genetic link and hypertension in the asian population based on the genetic predisposition for development of hypertension ace inhibitors should be considered in therapeutic treatment regimens for the south asian population hyperglycemia individuals with diabetes die on average years before individuals without diabetes and two thirds of those deaths are attributed to ascvd according to the international diabetes federation more than million asian indians have prediabetes south asians have a higher incidence of diabetes compared with non hispanic whites however even without overt diabetes south asians have reduced insulin sensitivity up to fold higher compared with other racial and ethnic groups which can be explained by increased visceral fat and genetic polymorphisms older age female sex physical activity and adiposity are strong indicators of insulin sensitivity and each of these may alter the relationship of hyperglycemia to oxidative stress and ascvd risk the prevalence of type diabetes is more than times higher in south asians than in other ethnic groups and the onset is as much as years earlier south asians have more insulin resistance in fasting and postprandial states than other page of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the south asian population ethnic groups and one third of south asians have metabolic syndrome possibly a consequence of increased obesity and ectopic fat deposition adiposity among nations categorized as major by the organisation for economic co operation and development india has the lowest rate of obesity in the world however south asians are much more susceptible to the deleterious metabolic effects of visceral adiposity visceral adiposity is well established as a direct risk factor associated with ascvd globally but is more prevalent in the south asian population in any body size visceral adipocytes not subcutaneous adipocytes are directly linked to increased inflammatory cytokines and the development of a proinflammatory state south asians exhibit the unique and deleterious obesity phenotype of increased visceral adipose tissue and lower lean body mass independent of waist circumference or body mass index although the most accurate measurement of visceral adiposity is computed tomography this option is not feasible equitable or efficient visceral adiposity is often measured with a waist to hip ratio healthy waist circumferences for most adult populations are cm for women and cm for men however recent guidelines specify that people of south asian ethnicity should have waist circumferences cm for women and cm for men the greater prevalence of visceral adiposity when compared with generalized obesity suggests rapid fat gain in a previously lean individual this type of fat gain places these individuals at higher risk for diabetes and metabolic syndrome and is thought to contribute significantly to ascvd risk tumor necrosis factor with increased insulin resistance there is a subsequent increase in circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor alpha interleukin and interleukin south asians have significantly increased high sensitivity c reactive protein hs crp which indicates a chronic low grade state of inflammation nonalcoholic fatty liver disease south asians have a genetic predisposition to development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld or hepatic steatosis which is a significant risk factor for ascvd nafld is exacerbated by a high sugar diet and abdominal adiposity which are also prevalent in the south asian culture because nafld is often asymptomatic the majority of individuals are unaware of their condition the prevalence of nafld approximately is similar between south asian and western populations individuals are predisposed to not only ascvd and cirrhosis but to hepatic and other extrahepatic malignancies the increased ascvd risk associated with nafld is independent of standard ascvd risk factors regression and resolution of nafld is primarily accomplished through exercise abstention from alcohol weight loss through intra abdominal fat mobilization and a diet low in sugar and refined carbohydrates these behavioral modifications are often the first line treatment for other comorbid conditions that commonly affect south asians vitamin d deficiency previous evidence indicates that vitamin d deficiency and insufficiency are becoming global epidemics it is estimated that billion people worldwide have vitamin d deficiency multiple epidemiologic studies continue to highlight vitamin d deficiency as a marker of cardiovascular risk promoting accelerated atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiovascular events there are rising concerns regarding the level of vitamin d in south asian populations nimitphong et al reported the existence of a high prevalence of vitamin d deficiency in south asians the vitamin d deficiency is predicted to be as high as in this population in comparison with citizens of western countries where studies indicate that vitamin d deficiency is present in only to of the total population poverty and lack of healthcare literacy regarding vitamin d deficiency remain underlying determinants that provoke vitamin d deficiency in south asians failure to associate the deficiency with inadequate exposure to sunlight skin pigmentation and insufficient consumption of dietary vitamin d compound the page of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the south asian population issue in addition cultural practices may discourage skin exposure and variation of the traditional south asian diet which is typically low in vitamin d containing foods hmicms ad environmental factors due to rapid cultural modernization and transformation from a rural agrarian population to an urban sedentary population and the propensity of genetic factors to take several years to display their effects a greater emphasis has been placed on modifiable environmental ascvd risk factors migration the general health status of migrants both within south asian countries and internationally is well studied well settled migrants in high income countries achieved rapid socioeconomic prosperity however rural to urban areas in low income countries remained poor and became unhealthier rural to urban migration in south asia is associated with decreased physical activity higher intake of dietary fats lower intake of fruits and vegetables truncal obesity hypertension and other cardiometabolic abnormalities associated with increased cardiovascular risk the general health status of migrant women has been demonstrated to be inferior to that of migrant men geographic location of south asian people may be the strongest cardiovascular risk factor discovered and is multifactorial it includes inadequate health care and infrastructure high levels of poverty and remote locations over the past years as south asian countries have become rapidly industrialized the prevalence of hypertension obesity hypercholesterolemia and type diabetes has increased significantly physical activity regular physical activity plays a significant role in lowering the risk of heart disease unfortunately the prevalence of sedentary lifestyle remains high in south asians south asian women are less likely to participate in physical activity than other populations more than of adults of south asian ethnicity report no recreational exercise during leisure time increased aerobic physical activity has been demonstrated to reduce visceral adiposity and ascvd risk independent of weight loss in white populations however until recently this has not been studied in south asian populations lesser et al found that south asians did not have a consistent reduction in visceral adiposity with moderate intensity exercise but did demonstrate a regular reduction with vigorous intensity exercise this may suggest an ethnic specific response requiring a greater exercise stimulus to mobilize fat cells active travel to and from work has been promoted within the south asian population to decrease ascvd risk gordon larsen et al found that active commuting was inversely related to obesity elevated body mass index blood pressure and triglyceride and fasting insulin levels and positively associated with elevated hdl cholesterol levels individuals who actively travel to and from work have higher overall physical activity levels and are less likely to be overweight or obese current world health organization guidelines recommend minutes of moderate intensity or minutes of vigorous intensity exercise per week more than of the population does not meet these recommendations it is of paramount importance to encourage the inclusion of exercise in the daily routine and to build infrastructure to support these recommendations diet important ethnic customs and cultural beliefs influence dietary intake and the south asian population is often exposed to high fat high carbohydrate and low protein and low fiber diets beginning in childhood these negative dietary patterns are correlated with increased inflammatory markers and insulin resistance in the south asian population specifically an increase in white rice consumption a staple of the south asian diet has been correlated with an increased risk of type diabetes the same correlation was made with increased consumption of refined grains high fat and high carbohydrate diets also increase plasma endotoxin levels which by downstream effect increases insulin resistance and inflammatory markers south asians consume large amounts page of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the south asian population of hydrogenated fat ghee butter milk ground nut oil trans fatty acids and coconut oil compounding these dietary risks refined sugar was invented in india in approximately ad and india is the largest consumer of refined sugar in the world in south asians particularly indians consumption of a large amount of sweetened food and beverages is popular the consumption of sugar sweetened foods is important to many traditions within the indian culture and it is customary to sweeten the mouth after each meal although sugar is a significant source of calories and a fundamental aspect of the indian culture the consumption of refined sugar and carbohydrates poses a significant threat to the long term health of an increasingly sedentary population with an innate predisposition to type diabetes and metabolic syndrome recent socioeconomic changes and cultural beliefs within the south asian population have contributed to the amplification of these negative dietary habits and predisposed an entire population to increased prevalence of ascvd dietary fiber and protein intake was negatively associated with insulin resistance inflammatory markers and improvement in asvcd risk in south asians similarly dietary intake of fruits and vegetables was negatively associated with insulin resistance and inflammatory markers in the same population a low protein diet was positively associated with islet cell dysfunction in south asians regardless of how much the south asian diet contributes to ascvd the diet is of central importance to cultural identity dietary suggestions often challenge the core principles of the south asian diet and it is thought that adhering to these suggestions makes someone less south asian and more american smoking there is a high prevalence of cigarette smoking and smoke exposure in the south asian population this identifies the great need to implement smoking prevention and cessation efforts tobacco related deaths are highest in india where of the world s tobacco users reside one million deaths annually are linked to some form of tobacco use approximately one third of the population in india aged years uses tobacco products in india youths initiate tobacco use every day current tobacco use has been documented in of school going youths aged to years tobacco use in people living in low socioeconomic areas is high in india approximately of children live in slums and low resource settings in these communities evidence suggests that tobacco use starts in children as young as years of age children in these environments lack the knowledge and skills to resist tobacco use and give in to social influences including peer pressure to use tobacco in a tobacco friendly environment hmicms ad tobacco use is a modifiable risk factor that is relevant to the global burden of chronic diseases the duration of tobacco use is an additional factor that needs to be considered some people go through start quit restart cycles therefore total exposure to tobacco use must be taken into consideration as a risk factor for chronic diseases smokeless tobacco and bidis are commonly used in india and bangladesh however manufactured cigarettes are preferred by most tobacco users the highest prevalence of smoking in india is in adolescent boys and men aged to years education levels and literacy are related to tobacco use individuals with higher levels of education use less tobacco than individuals with lower education levels the absolute number of adolescent boys and men aged to years has increased significantly in india over the past years stress a large body of literature demonstrates that in ethnic minorities chronic stress and disease exposure are linked to increased ascvd the belief that acquiring diseases such as diabetes or ascvd is not under an individual s control is prevalent among south asians this can be explained by the large spiritual foundation within the south asian culture and the belief that much of life is in a higher power s control and cannot be modified by the individual page of risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease in the south asian population conclusions the south asian population has many genetic risk factors for ascvd and needs to be monitored screened and treated appropriately to prevent ascvd education also needs to be provided to encourage healthy diets and physical activity this population is at higher risk for cardiovascular incidents at much younger ages it is essential that providers be aware of the increased cardiovascular risk factors among this population providers need to be diligent to appropriately treat this population to prevent cardiovascular incidents the advanced practice clinician is particularly well positioned to proactively screen and treat the south

weekly distributed by contify com all rights reserved length words byline afroz alam deya bhattacharya body afroz alam teaches at the department of political science maulana azad national urdu university hyderabad deya bhattacharya is a human rights lawyer and researcher based in bengaluru an examination of the sexual identity of gays through the prism of mainstream homophobic culture reveals that they are the nouveau marginalised section of contemporary indian society despite their diverse experiences the stigma is blatantly similar between homosexuals and other discriminated groups both of whom are prejudged on the basis of their identities and are impeded from standardised interactions with mainstream society as they are made out to be perverse and impure given the intensity of anti gay reactions and consequent stigmatisation of homosexuals we feel it is appropriate to refer to them as the neo marginalised of the modern world here we are not using neo marginalised as a term of any great precision such that we can rigorously and objectively assign some people to this category while excluding others instead it is highly evocative of the condition of the people that we seek to write about homosexuals or gays as they are colloquially known because of an established propaganda are treated as a most degraded lot who could be considered physically morally socially economically medically and legally untouchable the agony of these so called neo marginalised is the result of both disguised and manifest attempts to reinforce the institution of untouchability on gays by heterosexual bigots in classical times and even now powerlessness is the attribute which defines them they have and continue to experience the extremes of stigma however it is not plausible to argue that these neo marginalised do not resist the schemes that have come to define their conditions unlike in the past homosexual individuals are now refusing to live by the generalised standards and norms of heteronormative society and are reluctant of being confined to a secluded space in mainstream culture they assert their sexual identity with a touted preference to live a life of their choice a definite transition is taking place from being assigned mental disorders and sexual perversion homosexuality has come a long way to becoming what it is today a major issue of human rights violation this article aims to explore how and why the stigmatisation of gays by mainstream sexual identity is a definite reflection of how the dominant narrative attempts to invisibilise the deviant population sexual identity neither gays nor the discourse that characterises their sexual identity are alien to human society they are not inventions of the modern world both have always been in existence though in embryonic and ambiguous forms and limited to the solitary domain of gays themselves for a long time the assertion of sexual identity remained dormant the obscure beginnings of such assertion could be attributed to gays themselves owing to their habitual acceptance of the perverse sexuality logic of the mainstream and consequent dispersion of repression page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society the advantage of contemporary times has been the speedy decline of sexual taboos that weighed in on homosexuality the emergence of polymorphous sexualities and the explosion of a candid public discourse on the question of homosexuality and gays but the visualisation of such discourse is not without its tensions and problems the homosexual form of gays and their manifest assertion is not welcomed by the heterosexual norm of mainstream society because of its seeming incompatibility transgression and its phylogenetic background cote and levine however the lack of acceptance is not unique in the formation development and assertion of the sexual identity of gays but for almost all of human history individuals have taken to repression of their identities in order to uphold the uniqueness of the group here the proposition of erving goffman seems valid that the persistent stigmatisation and consequent repression ironically help the sexual minority to foster a sense of identity he further argues that because of the great rewards in being considered normal almost all persons who are in a position to pass will do so on some occasion by intent p in this context dennis altman rightly argues that the hostile reactions against the fostered sense of homosexual identity are temporary because of its transient character therefore altman suggests that homosexuals should continue to seek liberation from their own internalised oppression but disclosing one s sexual identity is not as easy a task as it is assumed eliason and schope the phenomenon has got further complicated because of the murky calculations of the benefit recognition and loss victimisation of coming out and remaining closeted fassinger and miller schope however the sexual identity of gays in a more general sense is understood in so many ways the biological sense in terms of gender social manifestations of sex sexual orientation etc gonsiorek and weinrich but what is common in almost all ways of classifying homosexual identity is the sexuality whether it is mental or emotional biological or social in this particular context of sexuality michel foucault s analysis holds definite and high ground he is of the view that sexuality functioned as a sort of essence in western society which emerged in and after the th century since then sexuality is considered as one of our fundamental truths he further argued that we do not choose our sexuality on the contrary it chooses us shapes us makes us who we are and yet remains profoundly other to our rationality and civility foucault also claimed that sexuality must be understood as an object of epistemic investigation it must be ensured that sexuality becomes known in a way he implicitly subscribes to the explanation that sexuality or sexual identity must be confessed sexuality of homosexuals is no exception to this rule moving further while exploring sexual formations judith butler proposes an account of what she calls the heterosexual matrix which characterises the gender hegemonic model she emphasises that for bodies to cohere and make sense that there must be a stable sex expressed through a stable gender masculine expresses male feminine expresses female that is oppositionally and hierarchically defined through the contemporary practice of heterosexuality butler she further argues that gays despite their homosexual identity are not radically outside the heterosexual matrix to support her stand butler proposes that there are structures of psychic homosexuality within heterosexual relations and structures of psychic heterosexuality within gay and lesbian sexuality and relationships p for her heterosexuality is not the only expression of power but also the construction of gay and straight sexuality it would not be wrong to assume that gays who fall in between this heterosexual matrix posed a serious challenge to the binary norms of the gender discourse interestingly while carrying forward the discourse ken plummer argued that homosexuality is nothing but a social construct developed by the heterosexual majority to restrict and pathologise a sexual minority he came out with a suggestion that this sexual minority should find acceptance and support from others within the gay world plummer plummer has also offered theoretical explanations about the formation of gay men s identity in four stages sensitisation significance coming out and stabilisation various stages page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society at this juncture it is important to recognise that there is a plethora of stage models available to explain the formation and assertion of homosexual minorities most particularly gays coleman but it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss each of them in exhaustive detail our aim is to identify their core arguments with marginal reference to the various stages to suit the purpose of this article vivienne cass s analysis of homosexual identity formation through six stages is one of the most cited works in sexuality studies she begins with the recognition that the homosexual identity of gays is very much rooted in the culture and history of western society to her sexual identity evolves out of a clustering of self images which are linked together by the individual s idiosyncratic understanding of what characterises someone as a homosexual p however after analysing behavioural patterns of homosexual personalities through five socio psychological stages of identity confusion identity comparison identity tolerance identity acceptance and identity pride she finally argues with a positive note that in the sixth stage of identity synthesis the homosexual identity of an individual brings balance and peace as his her identity becomes more acceptable to the heterosexual mainstream and one s sexuality no longer remains the central focus of discourse cass s claim though an exceptional theory is yet to be tested empirically on the other hand eli coleman after presenting the five stage model pre coming out coming out exploration first relationship and integration argues that the integration of homosexual identity with heterosexuals is not certain but he proposes that there is every possibility of achieving more compatible relationships with potentially more satisfying social networks in the heterosexual world in a similar study richard troiden states that sexual identities whether homosexual or heterosexual are not natural but socially learned while interpreting the meaning of sexual feelings to themselves and society in general after presenting his own five stage model spirals rather than linear sensitisation confusion identity assumption and commitment troiden proposes that despite achieving stable sexual identities individuals may have to remain hidden because of a homophobic social environment in a sense troiden agrees that the formation of sexual identity is never fully complete to be able to identify oneself with one s sexuality in public spaces and reach self actualisation however it is seen that theorists pursuing stagist models begin with the default assumption of an individual s heterosexual identity initially which later results in his her full recognition of homosexual identity the evolution of this sexual identity from the stage of self identification to synthesis into the gay subcultures and away from mainstream culture is imperative this is how the question of gay cultures and movements and a multicultural outlook in the assertion of homosexual identity comes into force we do not intend to argue that the formation of sexual identities of the gays is generally the same in all cultural settings of the world sexual identities are without a doubt culture specific in experience the formation assertion and recognition of sexual identities varies from culture to culture and across continents given the cultural variance we have confined our exploration of theoretic frameworks primarily to western society alone in doing so we do not mean to treat western culture as homogeneous there are visible subcultural differences within the west which demonstrate completely divergent views on the question of sexual identities we are also not denying the existence of cultural differences within gays themselves there are a great variety of categories to which gays may belong they can be at the same time european english black economist middle class strong believer in human values etc nevertheless one of the objects of exploring the theoretical construction of the sexual identity of gays is to understand how it actually affects them when assertions along these lines take place the questions are stark are homosexuals being judged through the yardstick of purity and pollution by the dominant identity that controls mainstream cultural debates are there any disguised or manifest attempts to reinforce the institution of structural violence and discrimination against gays by the dominant heterosexual class to explore the probable answer to these questions we need to explore how untouchability defines the conditions of gays in contemporary times gays as neo marginalised page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society it is both historically and empirically established that dominant groups often try to reinforce their social values and privileges by stigmatising those whom they wish to exclude however this conscious stigmatisation to preserve one s domination often helps in the formation politicisation and mobilisation of the identity of stigmatised groups butler this is also true in the case of gays who are treated as stigmatised individuals the stigmatised identity of gays has been externally imposed by the normative and coercive institutions of psychiatry and law enforcement valocchi however given the enormity of stigmatisation and persecution many researchers shifted their attention to understand how gays are responding to their situational dilemma of being unholy stigmatised impure turning them into the neo marginalised of modern society however the social experiences of gays fit into the frame of goffman s definitional analysis of stigma gays possess by the hostile propaganda of mainstream heterosexuals enough abnormal attributes to disqualify them as acceptable members of civilised society gays are the victims of heterosexism which has been understood as the belief in the inherent superiority of one pattern of loving and thereby its right to dominance lorde those who do not conform to the supremacy of heterosexual orientations are mistreated ridiculed and abused both physically and emotionally brooks savin williams the hostile common sense of heterosexism is evident in its expressions of heterosexual masculinity against gays which strongly prevents the development of intimate emotional and positive relationships between gay and heterosexual men herek herek and capitanio it is by the means of heterosexism that sexual hierarchies are created through which the dominant group tries to transmit binary sexual norms to shape the meaning of hetero homo divide in the public realm bower dennis this non acceptability of gays could be explained through the homophobic common sense paradigm institutionalised by the ideological system of heterosexism it is the irreconcilable conspiracies of the mainstream which have been perpetuated against the sexual orientation of gays for ages caramagno theological common sense is offered with derivative scriptural proofs to disapprove the very existence of gays and their homosexual identity keen and goldberg wolkomir moral common sense is developed to establish them as gravely depraved button et al keen and goldberg socio psychological common sense is articulated to mark them as intrinsically disordered pathological and antithetical to natural law danto duberman with the use of medical common sense they are declared sick d emilio katz legal common sense recognises the homosexual act of gays as criminal eskridge keen and goldberg even the judicial common sense was not ready to accept gay identity as an equally valid sexual identity keen and goldberg rechy thus on a general note gays are homogenised variously as deviant perverse outsider impure abnormal psychopath and degraded based on the general principle of heterosexual common sense it is with the help of these multiple common senses that both classical and contemporaneous mainstream society secured the tacit or manifest licence to habitually tease discriminate harass and ostracise gays berrill thus the subjection and oppression of gays by heterosexuals could be seen as an example of cultural imperialism young collective oppression tinney and an act of misrepresentation pharr in the overall design gays are reduced to what harry hay call an oppressed minority goldstein in a more generalised form gays are caught between social acceptance or criminality health or pathology liberation or retribution connection or isolation celebration or melancholia shepard like other marginalised groups gays themselves are for long and even now in some cases subjected to the dominant common sense by internalising the stigma crocker et al herek et al this has also been labelled as self stigma corrigan et al internalized heterosexism szymanski and chung and internalized homonegativity mayfield tozer and hayes they carry negative perceptions about their sexual orientations and foster strong apprehensions about their non acceptability by the sexual mainstream in general and their family friends and hometown in particular cabaj page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society smith tasker and golombok for long gays have also passively accepted the repression harassment and stigmatisation of and internalised homophobia in this particular context the constant fear of gays of losing their family and friends to cultural heterosexism could be possible reasons for internalising cultural homophobia cabaj greene however the internalisations do not result in the well being of gays rather it adversely affects them both physically and psychologically because of its character of sexual prejudice bernat et al herek and garnets yet it cannot be denied that contemporary writings simultaneously are responsible for demolishing mainstream common sense myths and misinformation about gays for example recent researches validate the argument that biological genetic influences contribute significantly to a gay s sexual orientation bailey and benishay bailey and pillard there are studies which prove that gays are physically mentally and emotionally normal friedman and downey gonsiorek and homosexuality is neither a psychic disorder nor a pathological one but is natural and always in existence throughout history conger boswell further on the sexuality of gays at the same time is a morally neutral phenomenon gomes mcneill there are studies which prove the growing acceptability of gays among those who know them personally haddock et al herek and capitanio and they in turn support gay rights wilcox and wolpert the findings of such research are enough to prove that preconceived notions are wrong and that gays make a conscious choice to go against the grain of mainstream society constant stigma despite these positive research homosexuals are constantly stigmatised discriminated and victimised in the public realms of modern societies the classical and contemporary prevalence of stigmatisation often brings psychological stress and depression in the lives of gays herek et al and adolescents lock and steiner chronic depression often results in developing a sense of alienation among gays which prohibits their chances of actual active and equal participation in modern society morton furthermore what adds to their existing stress is the negative attitude of heterosexual mainstream towards the children and family members of gays and the social activists who sympathise with them tasker and golombok in addition hate crimes contribute heavily to their existing psychological trauma mills et al szymanski which in some cases snowballs into suicidal tendencies among them bagley and tremblay remafedi both historically and contemporaneously gays have been imprisoned hanged witch hunted pilloried whipped confined in asylums burned to death excommunicated exiled disinherited evicted extorted entrapped censored declared mentally ill drugged and subjected to castration hormone injections lobotomy psychoanalysis and aversive therapies such as electroshock and pharmacologic shock amnesty international elze hrw it is also to be noted that gays are often blamed for inviting violence against them while the perpetrators are rarely arrested or prosecuted herek and berrill as a result violence and hate crimes against them are phenomenally increasing fbi herek and sims they are humiliated routinely by having objects thrown at them and by the threat of violence and verbal public abuse from the far right anti gay groups strikingly in the united states there have been more murders motivated by homophobia in than any other since the national coalition of anti violence programs began collecting data in it has been fraught with anti gay violence fatal hate crimes were committed against gays three more than the previous year s total shapiro the report states that despite increased acceptance of homosexuality publicly and politically the number of crimes against lesbian gay bisexual transgender and queer lgbtq people is the highest since for the first time hate crimes against gays had outnumbered those against religion page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society heterosexual cultural assumptions about gays reinforce the high level of marginalisation and their organised exclusion from both public and private employment thus creating economic and status inequalities egan et al the powerlessness of most homosexuals can be seen in their frequent experiences of discrimination and unfair treatment in some cases legally acceptable at their workplace badgett lyons et al discrimination at the workplace badly affects gay persons as it often results in low er prospects of career advancement or the denial of jobs altogether either by the means of termination or resignation d emilio johnson in most societies gay couples are denied leave to care for their partners access to benefits rights and privileges otherwise available to married heterosexual couples due to the absence of legal recognition of their relationships badgett it is certainly a denial of equal protection under the law the neglect of overlapping marginalisations and devaluation of diversities observed among gay experiences and identities depending upon age gender race class and religious affiliation is alarming greene and boyd franklin for example black gays are more marginalised than white gays krieger and sidney in many situations gays are also obstructed from religious places of worship by religious bigots lewis and rogers wilcox and wolpert in some cases the non acceptability and the consequent fear psychosis often pushes homosexuals to leave their homes to live on the streets ray such homelessness often leads them to fall into drug use and risky sexual behaviour which further results in mental health disorders cochran et al most importantly the issues and concerns of gays are overlooked in all sectors of education particularly health education social studies and other curricula gay students are not only treated with disdain by so called normal fellow students but also by institutional policies and norms which are highly discriminatory johnson and lugg they often miss out on education because of the lack of social support anti gay attitudes are reflected in scholarship programmes as gay students are deliberately barred from applying or receiving financial assistance severson they are often denied sexual health information related to hiv and other sexually transmitted diseases stds the homophobic attitude of teachers and non teaching staff affects their academic exercise terribly brus as a consequence gays are placed at the lower rungs of society and may have greater chances of remaining at a lower level even in the future in various circumstances the role of the media adds to the devastating anxiety of homosexuals the prejudice of the media is reflected in their frequent denial of airing positive gay content brewer gross and stereotyping gays as sexually obsessed finger snapping wig wearing etc jones and hill in this particular context there are studies which exclusively focus on how the media shapes and redefines the truth about sexuality which is eventually non beneficial to gays gamson walters similarly the internet is filled with anti gay quotes proverbs idioms phrases slangs abuses anecdotes and stories conclusions much has been written and done to expose the stigmatisation discrimination and victimisation of gays in the last three decades the growing positive discourse on sexual identity is also a great encouragement to gays to gain social recognition and public visibility but the paradox is that despite the ensuing progressive discourse and wide visibility of gays the radicalisation of anti gay attitudes discrimination and crimes have followed at unprecedented rates both gays and anti gay movements have parallely gained speedy momentum in our overall assessment gays are not able to gain a dignified status despite their incessant struggle to be integrated with the larger society homophobic violence against them is still a living practice gays are still counted as stigmatised they are still being defined through the perverse dichotomy of purity pollution perpetuated by the heterosexual mainstream yet gays are moving beyond stereotypes despite the structural disabilities imposed on them by the dominant culture for example even now homosexuals are discriminated against by the indian penal code section delegimitises the sexual identity of gays by criminalising sexual activities that are against the order of nature in page of is the gay community the neo marginalised of modern society the high court of delhi decriminalised this section allowing for sexual intercourse between all consenting adults however in december this judgment was overturned by the supreme court stating that the repeal of section was in the domain of the legislature and not the judiciary thus carving out another crusade for homosexuals in india the battle for legal acceptance of gay identity while establishing a connection we do not intend to argue that gays and other marginalised groups resemble each other completely the situational contexts of all groups are inherently different it is beyond the scope of this article to deal with this analysis exhaustively while comprehending the social roots of marginalisation first other marginalised groups such as women dalits and adivasis in india and the black community in the western world are stigmatised because of their birth in degraded families while gays have to experience stigma only after the disclosure of their sexual orientation second still other groups are treated as impure or polluted because of a theological construction and menial tasks they are assigned to perform whereas gays are also subject to similar treatment albeit on account of their so called deviance from the heteronormative logic but both differ in terms of their historic experience of identity formation third the identity of women is suspended in the gaps of the public private dichotomy and the untouchables are always visible but forced to live on the periphery of society gays for a long time were entirely invisible fourth gays are oppressed by the systemic existence of oppositional hierarchies created along the homo hetero divide fifth the sexual identity of gays is individual centric the family to which he is born will not be labelled as a sexually deviant family a gay joins the community of gays only when he discovers his different sexual orientation sixth gays are far ahead of other marginalised groups on the scale of socio economic status measured in terms of income education and occupation lastly the concerns of other marginalised groups such as women dalits and adivasis are all legally protected in india while gays are still struggling to get their concerns legally recognised one may rightly ask what is the need for comparison when all marginalised groups are strikingly different in the ways that they perceive their identities here we argue that differences between the various groups do not obliterate the strong similarities in terms of treatment they receive from their respective oppositional and dominant cultural groups they are all highly stigmatised culturally excluded socially segregated emotionally repressed misrepresented politically marginalised economically deprived physically victimised and frequently terrorised in their respective domains they are all untouchables per se with rising consciousness all these groups are now asserting their marginalised identities but the visibility and verbalisation of identity gays and the institutionalised anti gay reactions are becoming modern in character we therefore identify them as the neo

the present study is to evaluate hormones like free testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin in obese women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos this study showed that biological hormones such as testosterone were significantly higher that reflects low sex hormone binding globulin shbg in obese woman with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos compared to the age matched controls having normal body weight and ovulatory menstruation keywords testosterone sex hormone binding globulin shbg polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos luteinizing hormone lh follicle stimulating hormone fsh body mass index bmi enzyme linked immune sorbent assay elisa introduction polycystic ovary syndrome pcos is the most common endocrine disorder of reproductive aged women with an estimated prevalence of and is the most frequent cause of oligoanovulatory infertility it is a true syndrome with a heterogenous collection of signs and symptoms there are several clinical features which define the syndrome like menstrual cycle disturbances infertility obesity hirsutism acne there are many biochemical features like increased serum levels of luteinizing hormone testosterone and rostenedione and insulin it has been suggested that this condition occurs in as many as to of women in reproductive age group of to years with early onset in puberty furthermore obese patients with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos have more severe cardio metabolic risk factors compared with their lean counterparts it has been found that women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos are mainly overweight or obese showing the evidence that increase in body weight increases hyperandrogenic state in women sex hormone binding globulin shbg is a protein that binds to both testosterone and estradiol therefore it is important to measure sex hormone binding globulin shbg in all patients being evaluated for polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos page of a biological effect of sex hormone binding globulin and testosterone in polycystic ovary syndrome pcos obese women the sex hormone binding globulin shbg is a steroid binding glycoprotein which is synthesized in the liver binding to testosterone with high affinity and estradiol with low affinity there are many studies showing that insulin a hormone secreted by beta cells of pancreas is a potent inhibitor of sex hormone binding globulin shbg production by hepg cells and reduces the stimulatory effect of estradiol and thyroxine sex hormone binding globulin shbg levels are decreased by androgens administration of anabolic steroids low sex hormone binding globulin shbg levels increase the probability of type diabetes this study therefore sought to assess the biological hormones such as sex hormone binding globulin shbg and testosterone in obese women with polycystic ovarian disease pcos materials and methods in this study test subjects of about obese females of age yrs who are diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos with increased luteinizing hormone lh and normal or decreased follicle stimulating hormone fsh were taken control subjects included age matched non obese females with normal body massindex obesity was defined as bmi of at least kg m all these subjects were subjected to medical examination as per fixed proforma history regarding menstrual cycles allergy and drugs were assessed by interview and questionnaire anthropometric measurements like height weight bp and bmi were recorded in both the groups ml of venous blood was collected after an overnight fast and centrifuged serum was collected and then analyzed for hormones like free testosterone sex hormone binding globulin shbg are measured by using enzyme linked immuno assay elisa using microtitre plate results it was found that among the obese females of age yrs who are diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos table and the percentage of people with abnormal sex hormone binding globulin shbg evels out of the cases have sex hormone binding globulin shbg levels

with derangement in the metabolic profile and endocrine pattern in the present study we have attempted to measure hormones like testosterone and sex hormone binding globulin a low sex hormone binding globulin shbg concentration is associated with adverse cardiovascular risk factors and is considered an independent risk marker for the development of type diabetes in women the clearance and bioavailability of testosterone are affected by the concentration of sex hormone binding globulin shbg and variations in sex hormone binding globulin shbg levels would therefore be expected to influence the variability in serum testosterone sex hormone binding globulin shbg is a glycoprote in primarily produced in the liver and most commonly found in the bloodstream it binds to any of sex hormones including testosterone and estrogen and transports these chemicals throughout the body testosterone and sex hormones are referred to as bound when attached to shbg when these hormones are not bound to sex hormone binding globulin shbg they are referred to as free or bioavailable and can freely exert their effects upon your body sex hormone binding globulin orsex hormone binding globulin shbg is essential to maximizing the availability of testosterone the substance every woman wants to measure it is well known that a proper balance of testosterone and other sex hormones have a crucial impact on our health recent research has unveiled that imbalances of sex hormonesare often preceded by abnormalities in sex hormone binding globulin shbg high levels of sex hormones can lead to excess growth of cells leading to the formation of certain cancers such as breast cancer low sex hormone binding globulin shbg is also associated with elevated levels of triglycerides and low density lipoprotein ldl because of this low levels of sex hormone binding globulin shbg are linked with multiple cardiovascular illnesses in both sexes including heart disease type diabetes and high blood pressure our results show that in polycystic ovarian syndrome pcos obese woman the level of testosterone was significantly higher and found low sex hormone binding globulin shbg level compared to our control subjects conclusion this study shows that there is a significant change in serum testosterone levels and sex hormone binding globulin shbg it is found that patients with increase in serum testosterone levels have significant decrease in sex hormone binding globulin levels therefore it is very important to measure free testosterone as well as sex hormone binding globulin shbg in most

conclusion study found more prevalence of depression and stress as compared to anxiety among left behind wives keywords anxiety depression left behind wives stress introduction globalization brings opportunities for individuals to move from one place of world to another consequently this process of rapid shift results in migration of many individuals and communities throughout the world for exploring better prospects in the context of economic endeavors migration is a process where people move from one place to another with the intention of staying there permanently or for relatively shorter period of time overseas migrants in general and particularly from pakistan leave their countries mainly for the expectations of a higher income abroad which urge them to make such decisions to emigrate international migration from pakistan is a common phenomenon however this phenomena is distinctive from other countries in the context of emigrants workers leave their families behind and support them financially back home migration of only husbands for earning money have a considerable effect on their left behind families including their wives personal psychological page of determinants of depression anxiety stress among left behind families in azad jammu and kashmir managerial social and children discipline related problems scientific literature has identified the consequences of family members particularly husbands emigration in the context of psychological turmoil including depression stress anxiety emotional problems loneliness and feelings of insecurity among their spouses a longitudinal survey was conducted in indonesia between regarding psychosocial consequences of out migration which indicated that spouses left behind are more vulnerable to stress related illnesses such as hypertension and depression a great body of research has focused on life events as a causal factor in depression the role of stressful life events in triggering episodes of depression has been studied extensively psychological problems are precipitated by stressful life events such as separation loneliness strange environment displacement insecurity and the loss of a loved one in case of overseas migration wives of overseas migrants feel temporary loss because of separation loneliness insecurity feelings of anxiety because of communication gap with their husbands problems in children upbringing and work overload which make them vulnerable to develop symptoms of depression anxiety and stress and co morbid symptoms of other psychiatric symptoms studies conducted on filipino wives and gulf wives in india found that among left behind wives besides their increased responsibilities absence of their husbands produce certain amount of emotional stress and recurring thoughts about the safety of migrant husband which also causes more mental stress of left behind wives in pakistan some positive aspects of economic migration in terms of remittances were reported among left behind families including improvement in their economic condition social changes family relationships educational achievements savings and investment patterns however adverse negative impacts of migration were also highlighted such as lack of parental control in children substance abuse feelings of insecurity by migrant s female spouse and problems in arrangement of marriages of their sons and daughters another study conducted in rural area of pakistan faisalabad found that by assuming new responsibilities and duties in the absence of their husbands left behind wives felt loneliness and burdened particularly concerning the male children as a result they felt psychological strains in their husbands absence since history people of developing countries become migrants so large number of studies addressed remittances as a cause of migration but recently research has also started new trend of focusing on the impacts of migration on left behind families staying at their places in pakistan effect of economic migration on left behind family has mainly studied in economic perspectives and little attention has been paid to investigate the psychological sufferings of left behind family members some studies in pakistan have reported about psychological problems faced by left behind family members but these problems were not explored in depth neither they used any standardized psychological instrument with established psychometric properties for the measurement of psychological problems of left behind family members present study was conducted in two districts poonch and sudhanotti of the state of azad jammu and kashmir ajandk where large number of male members work abroad and their left behind families wives have been suffering at psychological level because of the absence of their husbands family heads present study is an attempt to investigate the psychological problems of left behind wives as consequence of the overseas migration of their husbands by using a standardized instrument it was hypothesized that there is difference on depression anxiety and stress between left behind wives belonging to nuclear and joint family system left behind wives having any physical illness or not having also showed difference in their scores on depression anxiety and stress present study also hypothesized that depression anxiety and stress are higher among non working as compared to working left behind wives of overseas migrants present study also measured the difference on depression anxiety and stress among left behind wives having different duration of their husbands migration years methodology page of determinants of depression anxiety stress among left behind families in azad jammu and kashmir cross sectional study design was followed for the present research study was conducted in international islamic university islamabad during august study was conducted after getting approval from ethical review board of international

technique age range of left behind wives of overseas migrants was from years participants were literate enough and were able to read scale items left behind wives with their husbands duration of migration less than a year were not included in the sample for the present study left behind wives were contacted individually at their homes by the researcher informed consent of the participants was taken before starting data collection and they were assured about the confidentiality of their responses towards each question after taking their consent participants were informed briefly about

analysis also showed p value discussion page of determinants of depression anxiety stress among left behind families in azad jammu and kashmir results of the study showed high prevalence of depression and stress among left behind wives belonging to joint family system as compared to nuclear family system while for anxiety present study showed non significant differences one reason for these findings can be that in nuclear families absence of their husbands make wives dominating and they feel free to make important decision of their home but in joint family they have to take care of each and every person in the family as they cannot make decisions alone it has also been studied that interpersonal problems within the family have been particularly important in triggering depression a study conducted in romania indicated that left behind family members suffer strongly on mental and psychological level stress and anxiety by having insecure feelings about their loved one as well as having adjustment problems with other family members give rise to a number of psychological disturbances present study also measured the difference on depression anxiety and stress among left behind wives having any physical illness or not and findings showed high rate of depression anxiety and stress among participants suffering from any physical illness findings of the present study are in line with some other earlier studies showing that left behind wives of overseas migrants have increased rate of physical and mental health problems including depression difference on depression anxiety and stress among working and non working left behind wives of overseas migrants was also explored in the present study results of the study showed high depression and stress among non working left behind wives as compared to working left behind wives while for anxiety study showed the non significant differences these findings are in accordance with a study which found unemployment and loss of family income s strong associated with depression a study conducted in gujrat pakistan indicated that non working women have more chances of depression as compared to the working women present study found significant differences on the scores of depression and stress among left behind wives because of the difference in duration of migration of their husbands while for anxiety non significant difference has been found number of researches indicates that episodes of major depressive disorder are precipitated by stressful life events as for left behind wives husband migration is a stressor so they frequently report their psychological problems in the form of depression and stress while collecting data for the main study it has been observed by the researcher that majority of left behind wives report about their problems in terms of sad depressed mood and stress as compared to anxiety this can be one of the reasons for having non significant differences on anxiety on multiple hypotheses so future studies can address this issue and can be planned specifically for measuring anxiety among left behind wives of ajandk conclusion study found more prevalence of depression and stress as

rights reserved section vol no length words byline muhammad ramzan muhammad bashir and faiqah ramzan body abstract background compelling evidence exists that the atherosclerotic process begins in childhood and progresses slowly into adulthood at which time it leads frequently to coronary heart disease the present study aims to determine the presence of non fasting hypertriglyceridemia in normal weight and obese primary school children years material and methods a total of school children with normal weight and obese were included in this study body mass status was determined according to the who criteria non fasting blood sample was used for lipid screening including triglyceride tg total cholesterol ch low density and high density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c and hdl c tg and ch were assessed by enzymatic and ldl c and hdl c through direct method results mean for the tg level was observed higher in normal weight girls mg dl than normal weight boys mg dl similar trend was observed in obese children mean for the tg concentration in obese girls was assessed higher mg dl than mg dl in obese boys the observed value of mg dl was calculated as normal for non fasting triglyceride in this study tg level of mg was taken as high and a risk factor for cardiovascular disease cvd same is recorded as in obese girls and in obese boys conclusion the present study has expressed a significant non fasting hypertriglyceridemia in obese children especially in obese girls non fasting lipid screening is a better option especially for children at risk for cvd and avoids the burden of fasting is convenient both for children and parents and that it is less costly and time consuming key words child cardiovascular diseases triglycerides cholesterol ldl hdl introduction there is increasing concern about the current and future cardiovascular health of the children and adolescents for a number of reasons i e high prevalence of childhood obesity recognition of hyperlipidemia as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease cvd and availability of treatment modalities for children gravity of the problem was recognized by the american academy of paediatrics aap and the american heart association to recommend the lipid panel screening for children as young as years who are at risk for developing dyslipidemia there is wealth of evidence to recommend the lipid screening of adults and children to fast for to hours because of changes that can occur in the test results during a postprandial test a number of difficulties are faced in screening of children for lipid disorders majority of children will have no fast before a routine visit to the page of profile of non fasting lipid levels in normal weight and obese school children of years age pediatrician the current visit has to be postponed both parents and children have to miss their office and school and is costly therefore most of the visits have to be preplanned furthermore enforcing the fast in children is more unpleasant than in adults these barriers to fasting in children make it difficult for the physician and parents to follow the guidelines for the lipid screening in spite of the physiological lipid changes related to fasting status recent research in adults and children have questioned the importance of fasting before the measurement a large number of studies have suggested that majority of the people who take in an average size meal the overall lipid profiles will have minimal postprandial change the triglycerides tgs reference intervals are higher male mg dl and female mg dl during the first year of life months this may be due to the milk rich feeding following first year tgs values decrease to their lowest levels male and female mg dl at years severe hypertriglyceridemia mg dl is a risk factor for pancreatitis and mild mg dl to moderate mg dl for cardiovascular events through the components of the metabolic syndrome hypertriglyceridemia is the result of either increased triglyceride rich lipoprotein production or impaired clearance catabolism of triglyceride rich lipoprotein chylomicron and vldl c or both factors that contribute to the hypertriglyceridemia are obesity excess alcohol and fats intake type diabetes mellitus presence of metabolic syndrome and genetic disorders there is controversary about the role of tgs as risk factor for cvd firstly tgs is inversely related to the level of high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c adjustment for the hdl c attenuates the relationship between tgs and cvd secondly there is variability in the postprandial tg levels and depends upon the composition of diet fasting state hrs is essential to have a more stable concentration of tg for risk assessment however postprandial tg rich lipoprotein remnants chylomicron and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol vldl c can penetrate the endothelial cell layer and reside in the sub endothelial space and contribute to the formation of foam cells a hall mark of early atherosclerosis absence of fasting burden would help both the parents and physician to reduce the barriers to lipid screening the objective of the present study was to determine the presence of non fasting hypertriglyceridemia in obese and normal weight school children of years of age material and methods the present study was carried out in primary schools located in the municipal area of district dera ismail khan to assess the lipid profile of primary school children years the evaluation was carried from june to december the study was approved by the institutional review board irb and board of advanced studies and research basr gomal university dera ismail khan pakistan informed consent was obtained both from the parents legal guardians and heads of the institutions these schools were having mixed population and included children both from urban and rural areas socio economical status was also variable some of the wards belong to the high socioeconomic group thirteen hundred and thirty six primary school children were included in this study with boys and girls thorough clinical examination excluded those suffering from chronic health problems children were lightly dressed without foot wear height and weight of each child was taken according to standard anthropometric techniques body mass index bmi of each one was calculated according to quatelets index bmi number was plotted on the centre for disease control and prevention cdc age and gender specific growth charts years to have bmi for age percentile body mass status was determined according to the reference data of world health organization who a child was considered underweight if his bmi for age percentile was th percentile and obese when his bmi for age percentile was more than th percentile normal weight child was having bmi for age percentile between th and th percentile while children having bmi forage percentile between th and th percentile were categorized as overweight page of profile of non fasting lipid levels in normal weight and obese school children of years age among the primary school children aged years were underweight were normal weight were overweight and were obese among the obese children parents of the children gave the informed consent and were included for the non fasting lipid analysis while among the normal weight children

conditions to have more stable concentrations for the calculation of ldlc levels to prevent the post prandial lipidemia hypertriglyceridemia and its effect on the measurement of hdl c non hdl c this provided the basis for the ncep atpiii classification of fasting tgs levels page of profile of non fasting lipid levels in normal weight and obese school children of years age the present study was designed to measure the serum tgs levels of school children under non fasting conditions the observed value of mg dl was calculated as normal for non fasting triglyceride in this study the findings of the kolovou et al are consistent with non fasting triglyceride level observed in the present study all the normal weight children had tg level with in the observed normal level of mg dl for the present study except of normal weigh boys and of normal weight girls twenty seven out of of the obese boys and of the obese girls had elevated tg level mg dl compared to the of the normal weight boys and of the normal weight girls gender difference for the non fasting tgs concentration was observed both in normal weight and obese children the findings of the present study are consistent with one of the yip serum levels for the tg male mg dl and female mg dl and ch male mg dl and female mg dl at the age of years was in agreement with our findings however no gender difference was observed tg

fasting triglycerides were observed higher mg dl than fasting for hours nhanes data indicates the mean fasting triglycerides are mg dl and of us population has high triglycerides mexican americans have the highest rates of triglycerides followed by non hispanic whites and african americans the exact level of triglycerides considered being a risk factor for cvds is unknown but it may be lower than mg dl in fasting the present study observed elevation of non fasting tgs mg dl as in normal weight and in obese school children ncep atpiii has proposed the fasting tg level mg dl as high for the clinical diagnosis of hypertriglyceridemia obese school children have expressed high level of triglyceride in boys and in girls as risk factor for cvd this observation is in agreement with the findings of the risk factor in the present study conclusion the present study has expressed a significant non fasting hypertriglyceridemia in obese children especially in obese girls non fasting lipid screening is suggested for children at risk for cvd it avoids burden of fasting facilitates both parents and children and make them available for office and school non fasting hypertriglyceridemia is

all rights reserved section vol no length words byline farideh doostan sahar mohseni takalloo and mohammad nosrati body abstract objective nowadays it is known that dietary imbalances are associated with non communicable diseases which would be a major cause of worldwide deaths in this study was conducted to assess the dietary pattern of students who live in a dormitory in kerman iran based on healthy eating index hei methods this cross sectional study was conducted on students who lived in the dormitory of kerman university of medical science the participants were recruited by multistage sampling their usual dietary intake was collected by using a valid food frequency questionnaire the diet quality was calculated via hei the hei score was categorized into three groups less than poor diet between needs improvement and more than good diet results the mean score of hei in the present study was of the participants had poor diet had to improve their diet and enjoyed a good diet the percent of energy intake from total fat saturated fatty acid solid fat and added sugar and also sodium were significantly lower in the highest category of hei than the lowest category there was no significant difference in the intake of cholesterol total vegetable and dairy products between the highest and lowest quartile categories conclusion majority of the participants need to improve their diet policy revisions and dietary interventions would require to promote diet quality and prevent non communicable diseases in the future keywords diet quality improvement students university iran jpma introduction the promotion and maintenance of good health through life is dependent on the balanced diet and nutrition of an individual it is now well demonstrated that dietary imbalances are associated with non communicable diseases such as obesity cardiovascular diseases diabetes and cancers cardiovascular diseases will continues to be a major cause of death worldwide in current evidences suggest an increasing trend in the prevalence of non communicable diseases and subsequent mortality rate in middle eastern countries such as iran over the past several decades researchers have attempted to define healthy diets among the populations the us departments of agriculture and health and human services has issued dietary recommendations the dietary guidelines for americans dga to reduce the risk of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases healthy eating index hei was measured overall diet quality and developed according to the sixth version of dietary guidelines for americans dga the hei is emphasizing on the important aspects of diet quality including whole grain various types of vegetables specific types of fats and introducing the new concept of discretionary calories this index assessed intakes of food groups and nutrients per kcal energy intake page of assessment of the dietary pattern of dormitory students in kerman iran although this approach results in balance among food groups intakes it does not consider each individual s needs for energy and extra energy consumption thus the hei assessed the quality of the relative proportion of consumed foods rather than the quantity of consumed foods the assessment of diet quality is an important factor in policy making monitoring service outcomes and designing research interventions quality assessment is also used for epidemiological research to monitor a population s diet and to evaluate nutrition interventions several studies have investigated the dietary pattern of adults based on hei it has been shown that among american adults all hei component scores were below the maximum standard except for total grains and meat and beans it has been found that socio demographic characteristics affect their food choices and overall diet quality in addition it has been reported that the diets of most adults in tehran were in needed of improvement and a relationship was found among nutrient intakes the number of servings from each group and the number of food items consumed since iran is experiencing a rapid nutrition transition and because standard quantitative dietary guideline is not available in this country it seems that the use of hei can be useful for nutritional assessment most of the college student do not pay enough attention to their diet for reasons such as lack of time lack of motivation stress taste preference lack of accessibility to fresh foods and financial reasons based on our knowledge no study has so far assessed the dietary patterns of iranian dormitory students this study was conducted to evaluate dietary pattern of students who lived in a dormitory in kerman iran based on healthy eating index subject and methods a cross sectional study was conducted on college students who lived in dormitory of kerman university of medical science kerman iran from december to june the sample size of the present study was obtained with power and a significance level of alpha was in addition according to the previous study standard deviation was considered study participants were selected using multistage sampling technique first total number of students who lived in dormitory of kerman university of medical science were identified based on fields of study then the sample size of each field was determined for each field a list that including all the students name was taken and the number of male and female students were determined afterwards based on the ratio of girls and boys in lists some of students were selected randomly participants with special diets receiving any special medication and over and under reporters of energy were excluded from the study finally the data for students which included females and males were analyzed the usual dietary data was collected using a valid and reliable semi quantitative food frequency questionnaire ffq which contained food items the trained dietitians completed the ffq during face to face interviews asking participants to report their frequency of consumption of each food item during the past year on a daily weekly or monthly basis these reports were converted to daily intake to help the participants to remind the amount of food intake food album was used since the iranian food composition table fct is incomplete due to the limited data on nutrient content of raw food and beverages we used the fct of the us department of agriculture usda in our study hei has been used to evaluate diet quality hei evaluates two major concepts adequacy and moderation of the usual diet through components the maximum possible score for hei is and higher scores signify a better diet quality since alcohol consumption has been prohibited in iran and participants would refrain from reporting their consumption and we were unable to measure the alcoholic beverage intake therefore the percentage of calorie intake from alcohol was excluded from the last component of this index and only the percentage of calorie intake from solid fats and added sugars was calculated as sofaas percent of calorie intake from solid fats alcoholic beverages and added sugars page of assessment of the dietary pattern of dormitory students in kerman iran the statistical analysis was performed using statistical package for social science version spss inc p value less than was considered significant all variables were shown to have a normal distribution the descriptive statistics of the baseline demographic and healthy diet characteristics of the participants were described using mean and standard deviation sd the comparison of characteristics and dietary intakes of the participants was preformed between males and females by using independent sample t test based on previous studies score of hei was categorized into three groups less than poor diet between needs improvement and more than good diet to compare the characteristics and dietary intakes of participants across the three categories of hei analysis of covariance was delivered to determine p trend within the three categories of this index linear regression coefficient was used ethical issues informed consent containing the information regarding the research objectives was obtained from all participants the study protocol was approved by the ethics committee number k and deputy of research and technology of kerman

after the adjustment of sex age and energy intake in the highest category of hei the total energy intake the percentage of energy intake from total fat saturated fatty acid solid fat and added sugar sofaas and also sodium were significantly lower than those in the lowest category there was no significant difference in intake of cholesterol total vegetable and dairy products between the highest and lowest quartile categories discussion in this population based study we evaluated the diet quality of students who lived in the dormitory of kerman university of medical science kerman iran based on hei the results of this study showed that the diets of most students in kerman needed improvement and there was no significant difference in hei total score between the males and females azadbakht et al analyzed adults in tehran and found similar results nevertheless total hei score in our population was seven points higher than the hei total score of american adults aged and above the total hei score provides an overall picture of diet quality while the component scores used to calculate the total hei score offer an opportunity to study the important components of dietary intake our findings showed that among hei components scores sodium had the lowest score this means that the participants sodium intake was much higher than the recommended amount in addition the participants received approximately about half of the maximum score of dark green and orange vegetables and legumes whole grains milk and oils items this indicates that receiving these food items should be taken in to consideration moreover the females had slightly higher intakes than the males with respect to total intake of fruit vegetables and oils and slightly lower regarding sodium intake since most of the students do not have enough time motivation accessibility and money to prepare and cook many types of foods thus the foods which are already prepared and given to students in dormitories and universities should possess appropriate quality it is recommended that more dark green and orange vegetables and legumes dairy and oil be used in students diet our results for the individual hei components can be compared to the findings of the hei assessment of americans adults similar to our report those findings showed that americans needed to eat less sodium and more dark green and orange vegetables and legumes whole grains and milk they also found low scores for calories from sofaas in contrast the score of calories from sofaas in our research was acceptable furthermore the mean scores of vegetables and fruits were much higher in kerman and tehran adults than their american peers this result may be attributed to the higher amount of fruit and vegetables consumed by iranian adults considering the fact that healthy diets contain more fiber fruit vegetables source of potassium and dairy products source of calcium and becasue there is a correlation between diet quality and these nutrients higher hei total score could be used as a sign of meeting these nutrient requirements moreover paying attention to each component of this index is also important previous studies showed that the higher diet quality scores were associated with improved biomarker profiles and reduced chronic disease risk tande et al found that hei was associated with a lower risk of abdominal obesity in americans also it was observed that higher hei score was associated with lower bmi and blood pressure in french men in addition in americans close concordance with dga were associated with favourable changes in hdl cholesterol and blood pressure lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and limit insulin resistance page of assessment of the dietary pattern of dormitory students in kerman iran in iranian population more compliance with the dga is associated with the lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome hyperglycaemia and low hdl obesity metabolic syndrome type diabetes and cardiovascular disease have emerged as epidemiologic public health problems among the risk factors of these disease special attention should be paid to diet as a controllable environmental factor therefore inappropriate diet quality of students is of great of concern and the policies adopted by the authorities should be revised in order to perform the required interventions especially with respect to foods given to students at the university and dormitory nutrition education for students may also be needed to highlight the importance of dairy products and its substitutes oils sodium and good scores for grains and vegetables one strength of our study was that it was conducted in a developing country under nutrition transition to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the diet quality in dormitory students in iran another strength was assessing separately each component of the hei in men and women however not having a standard quantitative dietary index for the iranian populations was a major limitation american dietary indices eg hei have been previously used in different countries because dietary indices are created based on the previous knowledge of healthful diets and they are applicable to different ethnic groups the second limitation was the inability to measure the alcoholic beverage intakes as a hei component thus this item was eliminated from the last component moreover because the iranian fct is incomplete and provides limited data on nutrient content of raw foods and beverages the american fct was used for analyzing the iranian diet conclusion the results of the present study revealed that the dietary patterns of most dormitory students in kerman were not in accordance with the recommendations of the hei as evident from the finding that indicated around two thirds of this population needs diet quality improvement the higher compliance with these dietary guidelines was positively associated with healthy lifestyle and better quality of diet in the students in kerman the unbalanced dietary pattern of the students is a major concern requiring prompt policy revisions and dietary interventions especially in foods that are given to students at the university and dormitory to promote diet quality and prevent non communicable diseases in the future it seems that nutrition education courses with an emphasis on how to use dairy products whole grains oils and sodium to students can help strength and limitation one strength of our study was that it was conducted in a developing country under nutrition transition to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the diet quality in dormitory students in iran another strength was assessing separately each component of the hei in men and women

voluntary or involuntary may significantly impact a person s mental health in the few studies that focused on employment status the results consistently show that employed participants were less depressed than unemployed subjects a study done in france revealed that unemployed men are found to have significantly higher prevalence of depression than the working population a study done in our

clinic peshawar pakistan after parental consent on male female children with age ranging years measurement of height weight waist circumference body mass index bmi blood pressure fasting lipid profile and fasting blood glucose fbg were recorded children with diabetes renal or lipid disorders and their sibs and those using metabolic profile altering medications were excluded from study results about

cardiovascular disease mesh dyslipidemia mesh cholesterol mesh cholesterol hdl mesh cholesterol ldl mesh triglycerides mesh cardiometabolic risk lifestyle mesh introduction cardiovascular diseases are the leading causes of morbidity and mortality all over the world previously prevalent among relatively affluent societies these disorders are now observed to be declining in most high income countries while rapidly increasing in many middle and low income societies in of the million deaths from cardiovascular diseases in the world were reported to be from high income countries while by only of the projected million of such deaths are expected to be from the rich countries the remaining being from middleand low income ones page of frequency of dyslipidemias in years old pakistani children a cross sectional study these shifting proportions of the burden of cardiovascular disease are observed along with a general epidemiological transition of burden of disease from predominantly communicable to non communicable diseases ncds which has been observed globally in parallel with social change and economic development in the eastern mediterranean region the burden of disease from ncds is projected to rise from in to by the year with the prevalence of dyslipidemia reported as high as in parts of the region according to estimates of disability adjusted life years in pakistan were from ncds a quarter of which were due to cardiovascular disease of which ischemic heart disease constituted more than with the projected increase of the burden of ncds these figures are expected to rise the modifiable risk factors for cardiovascular risk i e atherogenic dyslipidemia dysglycemia and high resting systolic blood pressure have been reported to originate in childhood and early adulthood addressing the pandemic of cardiometabolic risk in adult populations will require preventive efforts aimed at upstream risks in pediatric age groups in order to develop any effective preventive strategies in this respect recent information about the prevalence of these risk factors in the relevant populations is necessary the only two studies aimed at estimating the prevalence of dyslipidemias among children in pakistan both done at karachi are two decades old routine screening for dyslipidemia in children has been controversial and although the guidelines from the expert panel on integrated guidelines for cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents do recommend universal screening for dyslipidemia in children with a non fasting non hdl c at years of age such screening may not be feasible for pakistan still placed in the lower half of the world ranking of projected gross domestic product insights into the magnitude and socio demographic correlates of dyslipidemia can be very helpful in identifying clients with higher vulnerabilities to cardiometabolic risk in our community where the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome has been reported as high as the objective of this study was estimating the prevalence of dyslipidemias among school age pakistani children aimed at detecting the most prevalent form of lipid abnormalities in this population methods sample the sample was taken from among the healthy school age children of parents visiting the primary author s clinic based on the assumption of randomness regarding clinic visits all attending parents were requested to allow their healthy school age children to participate in the study not only the enrolled children were offered free examination but three free consultations at any time after enrolment were also offered to the family as an incentive children with known diabetes renal and lipid disorders or those with such disorders among their sibs as well as those using any metabolic profile altering medications were excluded data were collected over a period of months in for children ranging in age from to years data collection and measurement process parents who agreed to participate used to bring their school age children to the clinic any day they chose the children after a general physical examination underwent standardized height weight waist circumference and blood pressure measurements and information about their food habits and lifestyle was collected by interviewing the children along with their parents waist circumference of the children was measured in standing position at a point midway between the lowest ribs laterally and the iliac crest the information was reviewed and ambiguities clarified and corrections were made before the participants would leave the clinic investigation requests were given to the parents without recommending any single laboratory based on the assumption that lipid testing procedures are fairly uniform across the all major laboratories in the area page of frequency of dyslipidemias in years old pakistani children a cross sectional study early morning fasting blood glucose fbg and

females of years age respectively more than of these children had at least one lipid abnormality the most common being abnormal hdl c found in ci among these the borderline low category was the one more prevalent comprising ci of the children from this sample table iii the other lipid abnormalities in descending order of prevalence were those of total cholesterol hdl c and triglycerides table iv no statistically significant difference was found between genders regarding any of the lipid categories discussion our main finding is that of these children carried at least one lipid abnormality i e borderline or high low levels the most prevalent of these disorders was low hdl c reported to be similar in physicochemical characteristics to that related to adult coronary heart disease albeit more susceptible to intervention the fact that lifestyle interventions are effective in this situation is quite encouraging as most of these children with low hdl c are in the borderline high category badruddin et al reported higher mean levels of tc ldl c and hdl c among girls we have found the gender differences regarding lipid abnormalities to be non significant they reported of girls and of boys to be in the borderline high or high categories regarding total cholesterol our figures are and respectively statistically non significant albeit higher among boys both these studies included children years of age so we cannot make direct comparisons but lipid abnormalities may differ in various cultural subgroups based on the differences in lifestyles as well as socio economic factors while of the u s children have been reported to be in the adverse category of total cholesterol ldl c or hdl c we had almost of children in our sample ci belonging to this category the finding of low hdl c being the most prevalent anomaly among these children may be an indicator of the lifestyle issues in this population these children being from relatively affluent families may not be representative of the general population but still this finding requires clinicians attention not only for further confirmatory studies but also for interventional initiatives page of frequency of dyslipidemias in years old pakistani children a cross sectional study emergence of low hdl c as a prominent lipid abnormality has been an unexpected finding in this study as this abnormality is known to be related to sedentary lifestyle the study has brought to the forefront the need for incorporating preventive initiatives in the clinical practice of pediatrics a broad multifaceted and multipronged concerted effort is required to address this emerging threat health education for the society in general social dialogue regarding lifestyles relevant adjustments in the education system and policy decisions in many different areas of the existing socioeconomic structures is required through a collaborative effort of professionals in the relevant fields it is important to note that of the children with low hdl c were not obese or even overweight and without any apparent indications of a metabolic problem of potentially serious long term health consequences almost of these dyslipidemic children had waist circumference above th percentile the fact highlights the importance of assessing measures of cardiometabolic risk other than weight height or bmi the non obese child is the least likely to be screened for cardiometabolic risk or lipid disorders nothing in his physique or appearance will induce anyone even his physician to extend to him any help in this respect these silent victims of a demon running in their young blood consuming them from within need and deserve the attention of healthcare planners clinicians and the decision makers limitations the sample was chosen from among the families that visited the author s private clinic generally these families are relatively affluent and the findings cannot be generalized to general population higher values of blood pressure reported here may be the result of the measurement process environment but children with abnormal metabolic profiles may be prone to exhibit abnormal adrenergic responses and further studies are needed to clarify this conclusion this study has provided estimates of frequency of dyslipidemias in years old pakistani children attending a pediatric clinic dyslipidemia is very common in these children and of children had at least one lipid abnormality low level of hdl c is the most prevalent lipid abnormality in this population about of the participants were either obese or overweight the fact that the dyslipidemic profile of our school age children is suggestive of lifestyle issues has highlighted the need for addressing this issue through multi sector efforts pediatricians need to work with public health professionals healthcare planners and decision makers to initiate public awareness and health education political involvement needs to be generated in order to make selective screening facilities available for an average pakistani child there is also a need for further larger population based studies to document the true prevalence and patterns of

smoking cigarettes presence of family history of hypertension are likely to predict hypertension to conduct this study seventy eight n cases with diagnosis of hypertension aged between to years and n community matched controls were recruited through purposive sampling technique to measure psychological factors the perceived stress scale by cohen kamarck and mermelstein and kessler psychological distress scale developed by kessler andrews and colpe were used waist hip ratio and body mass index were calculated with the help of height waist hip circumference and weight measurements information regarding smoking status and frequency and duration of physical activity was ascertained information sheet was constructed to gather demographic and medical information binary logistic regression analysis model revealed that women current smokers and those having a family history of hypertension were at a risk for hypertension high level of distress and absence of four or more hours of physical activity per week were significant predictors for hypertension in order to circumvent certain temporal confounds we propose prospective longitudinal and interventional studies to be carried out in the future keywords psychological stress distress anthropometric lifestyle hypertension hypertension commonly known as high blood pressure continues to be a foremost public health concern for pakistan though the cause may not be known research endorses that primary hypertension is associated with a number of factors genetic behavioral environmental or a psychological in pakistan there are an estimated million people facing this condition in pakistan among them million men and million are women hypertension affects one in three individuals over the age of years nishtar et al and prevalence of high bp is one in three over the age of years prevalence among pakistani females is lower compared to males however it exceeds after the age group of years pakistan medical research council pmrc prevalence clinical repercussions and medical costs linked with hypertension points towards a clinical emergency that needs prompt attention of researchers and clinical health experts siegler peterson barefoot and williams risk factors associated with hypertension fall in three categories a physiological eg coronary artery disease diabetes mellitus and kidney disease b behavioral factors smoking diet sedentary lifestyle and last c psychosocial factors that are stress anger anxiety burnout depression and social support and depression taylor delaney et al a part from the traditional non modifiable risk factors such as age gender family page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population history etc there are many modifiable risk predictors associated with hypertension e g lack of physical activity smoking etc yusuf hawken and ounpuu the fact that hypertension is associated with many psychological physiological and lifestyle risk factor is well established allison et al rahman and ahmad obesity physical inactivity and smoking are other established lifestyle risk factors for hypertension hardoon et al siegler et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts sims carroll phillips gale and batty the pathogenesis of obesity related hypertension can be understood in the light of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system obesity is associated with increased blood flow vasodilatation cardiac output and hypertension the factors that contribute in onset of hypertension due to obesity include enhanced sympathetic tone activation of the renin angiotensin system ras hyperinsulinemia structural changes in the kidney and elaboration of adipokines hormones produced in fat itself such as leptin rahman and ahmad besides relationship between behavioral risk factors negative affect has also found to be a risk for hypertension allison et al researchers have endorsed that risk of hypertension due to anger anxiety and depression is comparable to that of obesity and lack of physical activity chida and steptoe studies examining the association of hypertension with psychological distress such as anxiety and depressive symptoms have produced mixed findings few studies have reported positive associations patten et al carroll et al while others have found a weak delaney et al or no associations yan et al studies highlight that stress may not directly cause hypertension but it can lead to repeated blood pressure elevations which eventually may lead to hypertension mousa yousef riccardo zeidan and sabatinelli the terms stress and distress cannot be used interchangeably there is likely to be a difference in stress and distress that needs to be accentuated distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being nrc research validates that biological and behavioral pathways link psychological factors to an increased risk of hypertension shihab et al psychological factors have found to associate with long term blood pressure and the evidence dates back to as far as the early th century alexander theories regarding mechanisms for this probable relationship reveal that psychological factors like prolong stress anxiety depression anger hostility etc can directly alter physiological process leading to hypertension altered physiological processes that have found to increase the risk of hypertension include vascular and endothelial changes increased sympathetic tone baroreflex sensitivity vascular stiffness bp variability and central opiodergic mechanisms kaplan pettersson manuck and olsson cardiovascular reactivity which is a recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity up regulates basal blood pressure levels matthews woodall and allen neuro hormonal models point out that psychological factors like stress distress anger etc may precipitate development of hypertension as they modify functioning of the central nervous system pickering and gerin it is likely that multiple converging pathways lead to hypertension psychological factors link with hypertension through the high risk behavioral environmental pathways the other pathway is constitutional disposition these dispositions are associated with psychological characteristics like poor diet obesity exercise habits smoking age etc james krantz and manuck it is important to note the bi directional association between psychological factors and behavioral environmental and constitutional factors is present roy janal and roy even in the light of substantial evidence that is in favor of these theories much of the published literature has received criticism based on methodological grounds james regardless of rigorous research and evidence at hand into the etiology of hypertension the pathogenesis of the problem is still not fully explained empirical page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population evidence in this regard is limited therefore a well designed study to explore relationship of psychological lifestyle and anthropometric factors with hypertension is warranted the decline in mortality and ailment can be forecasted as most of the psychological and lifestyle risk factors associated with the onset and progression of hypertension are modifiable and can be countered through the use of primary and secondary preventive and interventional strategies iqbal ridwan takari and mulyono roy janal and roy most risk factors of hypertension are modifiable controllable as well as preventable by health education and promotion hence timely identification of these risk factors can help to encounter the disease burden however evidence in this regard from across the globe cannot be considered ultimate for the native population as several factors can vary with ethnicity kearney whelton reynolds whelton and he there is dire need to conduct studies on risk factors of hypertension for different ethnic groups and across countries even in the presence of substantial evidence literature is still not conclusive about the comparative features of all the risk factors of hypertension the knowledge of risk factors for hypertension is largely derived from research conducted in the developed countries though psychological and behavioural and lifestyle risk factors may vary between populations and differ due to ethnic diversity this is one of the reasons that effects of psychological factors on risk of hypertension in the world still remain hotly debated kehoe wu leske and chylack researcher s irresolution about research findings from the western and european populations remain questionable in terms of applications to rest of the world multifactorial etiology and clustering of factors comorbidity explain risk of hypertension rozanski blumenthal and kaplan current research has a methodology designed to examine multiple risk factors simultaneously and in both men and women in a sample of pakistani population most of the available literature explaining risk of hypertension comes from either cross sectional or experimental studies that have mostly been carried out in the west delaney et al ramachandruni handberg and sheps already available literature on psychological risk factors of hypertension has revealed ambivalent results among psychological risk factors anger variables anger in anger out trait anger etc were the most studied reported associations followed by anxiety depression and others defensiveness neuroticism psychopathology social networks with one reported association each chida and steptoe limited evidence exists regarding the role of stress and distress in onset and progression of hypertension ramachandruni et al prospective studies circumvent certain temporal confounds and could have been the best choice of methodology to infer the proposed psychological anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors of hypertension but they require sustained funding and follow up over a period of at least several years as a result one of the methodologies best suited to address the impact of psychological factors on hypertension has contributed less than of the empirical work in this area the time cost and expenses involved in a prospective longitudinal study were beyond the scope of this research justification and likely benefits this study focuses on multifactorial assessment of risk factors prevalent within the pakistani population identification of these multiple risk factors can help in planning and designing primary and secondary preventive approaches to combat growing epidemic of hypertension within pakistan preventive approaches are cost effective and can help to reduce the medical cost and disease burden for pakistan a country that has limited economic resources and health budget is extremely low objectives to date assessment of risk factors for hypertension has hardly been given due attention in pakistan moreover many psychological factors like stress and distress have never been investigated within the native population the aim of this study is to assess whether perceived psychological stress distress anthropometric measurements body mass index and waist hip ratio lifestyle factors history of smoking and physical activity and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension are significantly associated with the risk of page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population primary hypertension the aim of our research is to assess multi factorial risk assessment of hypertension among a sample of pakistani population hypotheses high levels of perceived stress and distress will predict hypertension as compared to low levels of perceived stress and distress greater bmi greater than kg m will predict hypertension as compared to low bmi less than kg m high whr abdominal obesity will predict hypertension as compared to low whr physical activity of less than hours per week will predict hypertension as compared to physical activity of greater than hours per week being a smoker will predict hypertension as compared to being an ex smoker or non smoker presence of family history of hypertension before the age of in blood relatives as compared to absence of family history of hypertension will predict hypertension research design method case control research design was employed for the present study sampling strategy a purposive sampling strategy was employed to conduct the study because the sample was selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria sample to investigate the association of the aforesaid factors with risk of hypertension and to find whether these factors differ between cases and the controls we solicited a sample of patients with confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and controls who were free of hypertension before and at the time of testing cases with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension by doctors on mg and currently taking medicines both male and female aged between to years were included in this research controls selected were community based they were either visitors or non blood relatives of the cases diagnosed with hypertension matched for age and gender one control per case was recruited table demographic

exclusion criteria for cases diagnosed with hypertension patients having chronic or terminal medical illness including coronary heart disease liver disease and cancer certain chronic conditions may increase risk of hypertension and were also excluded like high cholesterol diabetes kidney disease and sleep apnea patients with asthma gout and pregnant females were excluded from the study patients with history of any psychiatric diagnosis or psychiatric medication and patients having blood pressure less than were excluded moreover participants failing to provide a written consent and those unable to read and write urdu language were excluded community controls were drawn from the community matched to every case of hypertension for age up to years older and younger and gender community controls were visitor s or non blood relatives of the cases diagnosed with hypertension only participants with no prior history of hypertension were included as controls exclusion criteria for matched controls a similar exclusion criterion as that employed for the cases was used for the selection of the controls assessment measures medical and demographic information sheet demographic information was gathered on variables like age gender education marital status duration since hypertension was diagnosed family history of hypertension information regarding smoking status current ex smoker non smoker the perceived stress scale pss cohen kamarck and mermelstein developed pss that computes magnitude of stressful situations in one s life and the present level of experienced stress on a item scale each item is measured on a point likert type scale never almost never sometimes fairly often very often the pss has four positively worded items and that are reversed scored a total score on the

lifestyle risk factors for hypertension patten et al rosengren et al smoking the information regarding smoking was obtained that included smoking status current ex smoker and non smoker for smokers who reported smoking cigarettes further information regarding age at which smoking was started and number of cigarettes smoked per day was obtained current smokers were defined as individuals who smoked cigarettes or beedis homemade traditional cigarette in the past year months ex smokers were defined as individuals who had given up smoking more than a year ago non smokers were defined as those who do not smoke at present and have never smoked in the past a similar criterion has been employed in other studies carried out on the pakistan population nishtar et al translation of assessment scales permission for translation and use of instruments for conducting present study was appropriately sought from authors of all the scales to ensure a rigorous process of translation as well as to achieve equivalence between the original version and translated versions of scales vallerand s steps for instrument translation with slight modification were employed wongsri cantwell and archer these steps have found to decreased risks of errors and improved the precision of translation the first step involved forward translation from english version into urdu each and every one amongst the three translators had prior experience of translating questionnaires and were knowledgeable about content of the questionnaire and had substantial experience in using likert type scales during the second step rating of translated scale items by native experts was carried out all translations obtained after the forward translation procedure were rated by two bilingual native speakers step involved an item by item review of the three translations in a panel discussion comprising of three members the final target version of the translation was produced after comprehensive discussion by the members of the panel problematic items for which a mutual consensus was not reached by the members of previous panel discussion were taken up by another voluntary panel that comprised of three new members after the second panel discussion a final draft of comprehensive target translation the forward translation based on mutual agreement on item wise review was produced this final draft was given to an expert in urdu language the proof read draft thus finalized was then backward translated by three blind translators who were known language experts with established competence in english as well as urdu language a panel of three bilingual experts was formulated to review similarities and differences between the original english version of the scales and the back translated version final draft of the consensus translation was produced following agreement by all the members of the designated panel on all items procedure an institutionalized consent was sought from regulatory and ethics committee of the hospitals before starting the research sample was gathered from six hospitals all over pakistan after explaining the purpose of the study to the page of psychological stress

evidence has been endorsed by other researches chronic raise in negative affect elevates blood pressure many psychological factors stress anger anxiety hostility depression lack of social support and type a behavior pattern have been associated with risk of hypertension jonas and lando kamarck polk sutton tyrrell and muldoon studies have endorsed a hypertension risk difference of almost between high psychological distress and low psychological distress groups rutledge brenda and hogan our study findings seem to be in line with the evidence gained from countries the interheart study these researchers found a significant relationship between distress and hypertension rosengren et al distress through behavioural pathway can lead to hypertension distress directly affects dietary habits and health seeking behaviours both in humans and animals greeno and wing studies have found that distress hinders performance of global health behaviours wiebe and mccallum and decreases the use of positive health behaviours such as exercise and proper diet lindquist beilin and knuiman consequently it increases use of maladaptive health behaviours like consumption of food rich in fats smoking and excessive use of alcohol it has been understood that distress can result in priority change in health promoting behaviours as other matters may become the center of attention griffin friend eitel and lobel explored was stress there is likely to be difference in stress and distress that needs to be emphasized as scientific community many a times uses the term interchangeably distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg nrc stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being stress did not turn out to be a significant risk factor of hypertension within the pakistani sample several studies have emphasized stress to be a significant predictor of hypertension nishtar et al evidence accrued that cardiovascular reactivity to stress is characterized by recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity that is likely to up regulate basal blood pressure levels over time laboratory research suggests that during periods of mental stress nerve firing increases ramachandruni et al and raises levels of catecholamine s serotonin hr heart rate and bp blood pressure schwartz et al changes like raised levels of circulatory page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline termed as the adrenaline hypotheses play a significant role in onset and progression of hypertension floras major reason for the disparity in the study results can be attributed to the fact that evidence of stress as a risk factor of hypertension mostly exists from prospective cohort studies greater than year follow up everson et al likewise methodological protocols sample size and sampling strategy use of instruments to assess study variables employed by these researchers are quite dissimilar to that adopted in our study prospective studies of psychological factors on blood pressure can offer a means of evading certain temporal confounds and need unrelenting funding and follow up over a period of at least a number of years critical flaw in the argument that psychological factors play a role in the development of hypertension is the relative absence of prospective data pickering and gerin differences in definition of hypertension eg vs mm hg use of clinic based vs ambulatory blood pressure measurement methods appropriate control for covariates ie multivariate vs univariate leads to differences in identification of risk factors jonas and lando results studies that have investigated psychological risk factors have not tried to explain the potential mechanisms involved in onset of hypertension everson et al scales previously used to infer psychological factors of hypertension are mostly whose psychometric properties are often not established they contain few items that often lacking independent validation james mostly studies conducted on risk factors of hypertension have taken psychological factors as secondary to the already host of non modifiable traditional factors like age gender and family history of hypertension however in our study both scales to measure distresses as well as stress have well established psychometric properties these original scales were translated into urdu language and there psychometric properties were determined through the process of validation among traditional non modifiable risk factors gender was found to be a significant risk factor of hypertension in our sample females compared to males were found to be at a greater risk for hypertension more women are found to be hypertensive and earlier than men jafary levey and jafar pmrc the differences in gender for the prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases remain large in countries across the globe zhang sasaki and kesteloot some differences in risk factors for hypertension between women and men in rural bihar ghosh sarkar mukherji and pal and assam india have been identified hazarika biswas narain kalita and mahanta differences in hypertension prevalence by region and income in some places men have higher prevalence while in others women do have been identified in a cross sectional survey conducted on low income settlement in the city of karachi lahore the overall prevalence of hypertension was the prevalence among males was higher than females safdar omair faisal and hasan we gathered our study sample from the city of lahore punjab and risk of hypertension was found to be greater in women compared to men women in punjab compared to men are more obese overweight less physical activity being overweight and physically inactive ghosh et al zhang sasaki and kesteloot this could be a reason why women were found to be more hypertensive in our sample recruited from lahore situated in the province of punjab obesity and lack of physical activity are independent predictors of hypertension sims body mass index as a combined result from total calorie intake physical activity and genetic factors play an important role in determining the level of blood pressure individually and between populations hardoon et al smoking family history of hypertension and lack of useful level of physical activity of less than four hours were found to be other significant risk factors of hypertension obesity physical inactivity and smoking are established risk factors for hypertension ahmad ahmad zulfiqar jan and rehman hardoon et al smoking page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population obesity and physical inactivity are higher in people with elevated psychological stress and in those diagnosed with hypertension everson et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts increased prevalence of hypertension itself is related to weight gain cordon clark mueller and hovis however neither increased bmi nor whr turned out to be significant risk factors of hypertension in our research research evidence exists from a long term prospective study men who were overweight or obese in early adulthood or middle age were at higher risk of hypertension later in life overweight or obese men were consistently at higher risk of hypertension across the entire period of follow up obesity in young adulthood conferred a fold risk of hypertension shihab et al bmi does not distinguish between weight associated with muscle and weight associated with fat and the relationship between bmi and body fat content varies according to body build and proportion garrow furthermore bmi cannot make a discrepancy between fat and muscle mass ashwell in contrast the measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect changes in hypertension and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and other forms of chronic diseases is better than bmi whr as a measure of risk of hypertension and other diseases has been recently challenged to due to several reasons first hip circumference cannot be obtained routinely and the measure is more difficult to perform and less reliable second whr is not useful in practical risk management as the ratio could remain constant when the weight of individual increases or decreases ashwell wang in future studies need to be designed by considering measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect a precise association with hypertension moreover intervention trials in which participants are selected on the basis of high standing on one or more factors epitomize an additional avenue for likely future research delaney et al the need is to conduct prospective studies for improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship of obesity bmi and whr with blood pressure to sum up the results of our study provide statistical support for the proposed relationship between psychological non modifiable factors and risk of hypertension the status of psychological factors as a clinically important risk factor for high blood pressure appears promising but additional research potentially including prospective longitudinal and intervention trials will be necessary to further infer this prediction mechanisms explaining this potential relationship remain speculative and should continue to be a focus of research among behavioral medicine investigators the inclusion of multiple samplings adds yet another layer of difficulty to prospective studies but the probable benefits of improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship between psychological factors and blood pressure may be important enough to motivate us to overcome this obstacle research must go further by actively proposing and testing meditational relationships that will better allow us to assess potential mechanisms in these relationships nearly all studies to date derived their estimates of psychological effects on hypertension from a single point estimate of psychological functioning there is evidence to indicate that many personality characteristics are relatively stable over long intervals other psychological characteristics such as depression are known to fluctuate limitations the findings of our study are susceptible to an inability to control for competing explanations for example the possibility that alternative mechanisms genetic or environmental could dispose both psychological characteristics and hypertension risk that blood pressure increases may precede rather than follow psychological factors may similarly serve as a non causal marker for disease onset and progression and are among the most frequently cited shortcomings by other researchers too krantz and manuck pickering and gerin in spite of certain limitations the study highlights a need to move beyond the conventional approaches to assess traditional factors associated with the risk of primary hypertension moreover this study draws attention towards call for assessment of psychological risk factors like distress along with assessment of traditional modifiable anthropometric and lifestyle and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension this page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population study also provides direction for designing primary and secondary preventive approaches based on identified psychological anthropometric lifestyle and traditional risk factors present within the pakistani population preventive approaches to counter the growing epidemic of hypertension need to focus on creating awareness regarding smoking as a risk factor for hypertension preventive strategies should target at creating awareness towards increasing the level of physical activity to four or more hours per week timely psychological management of distress needs to be highlighted as distress has found to predict hypertension public should be made aware of the fact that women as well as families who have a blood relative with hypertension before the age of are at a greater risk for hypertension last but not the least the study endorses directions for prospective longitudinal research research potentially including intervention trials will be necessary to further shed light on this issue conclusion to prevent an epidemic of cardiovascular disease in pakistan hypertension control by screening treatment and primary prevention of identified risk factors will be an important

distress bmi greater than kg m and high whr waist hip ratio lack of useful level of physical activity smoking cigarettes presence of family history of hypertension are likely to predict hypertension to conduct this study seventy eight n cases with diagnosis of hypertension aged between to years and n community matched controls were recruited through purposive sampling technique to measure psychological factors the perceived stress scale by cohen kamarck and mermelstein and kessler psychological distress scale developed by kessler andrews and colpe were used waist hip ratio and body mass index were calculated with the help of height waist hip circumference and weight measurements information regarding smoking status and frequency and duration of physical activity was ascertained information sheet was constructed to gather demographic and medical information binary logistic regression analysis model revealed that women current smokers and those having a family history of hypertension were at a risk for hypertension high level of distress and absence of four or more hours of physical activity per week were significant predictors for hypertension in order to circumvent certain temporal confounds we propose prospective longitudinal and interventional studies to be carried out in the future keywords psychological stress distress anthropometric lifestyle hypertension hypertension commonly known as high blood pressure continues to be a foremost public health concern for pakistan though the cause may not be known research endorses that primary hypertension is associated with a number of factors genetic behavioral environmental or a psychological in pakistan there are an estimated million people facing this condition in pakistan among them million men and million are women hypertension affects one in three individuals over the age of years nishtar et al and prevalence of high bp is one in three over the age of years prevalence among pakistani females is lower compared to males however it exceeds after the age group of years pakistan medical research council pmrc prevalence clinical repercussions and medical costs linked with hypertension points towards a clinical emergency that needs prompt attention of researchers and clinical health experts siegler peterson barefoot and williams risk factors associated with hypertension fall in three categories a physiological eg coronary artery disease diabetes mellitus and kidney disease b behavioral factors smoking diet sedentary lifestyle and last c psychosocial factors that are stress anger anxiety burnout depression and social support and depression taylor delaney et al a part from the traditional non modifiable risk factors such as age gender family page of psychological stress

and ahmad obesity physical inactivity and smoking are other established lifestyle risk factors for hypertension hardoon et al siegler et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts sims carroll phillips gale and batty the pathogenesis of obesity related hypertension can be understood in the light of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system obesity is associated with increased blood flow vasodilatation cardiac output and hypertension the factors that contribute in onset of hypertension due to obesity include enhanced sympathetic tone activation of the renin angiotensin system ras hyperinsulinemia structural changes in the kidney and elaboration of adipokines hormones produced in fat itself such as leptin rahman and ahmad besides relationship between behavioral risk factors negative affect has also found to be a risk for hypertension allison et al researchers have endorsed that risk of hypertension due to anger anxiety and depression is comparable to that of obesity and lack of physical activity chida and steptoe studies examining the association of hypertension with psychological distress such as anxiety and depressive symptoms have produced mixed findings few studies have reported positive associations patten et al carroll et al while others have found a weak delaney et al or no associations yan et al studies highlight that stress may not directly cause hypertension but it can lead to repeated blood pressure elevations which eventually may lead to hypertension mousa yousef riccardo zeidan and sabatinelli the terms stress and distress cannot be used interchangeably there is likely to be a difference in stress and distress that needs to be accentuated distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being nrc research validates that biological and behavioral pathways link psychological factors to an increased risk of hypertension shihab et al psychological factors have found to associate with long term blood pressure and the evidence dates back to as far as the early th century alexander theories regarding mechanisms for this probable relationship reveal that psychological factors like prolong stress anxiety depression anger hostility etc can directly alter physiological process leading to hypertension altered physiological processes that have found to increase the risk of hypertension include vascular and endothelial changes increased sympathetic tone baroreflex sensitivity vascular stiffness bp variability and central opiodergic mechanisms kaplan pettersson manuck and olsson cardiovascular reactivity which is a recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity up regulates basal blood pressure levels matthews woodall and allen neuro hormonal models point out that psychological factors like stress distress anger etc may precipitate development of hypertension as they modify functioning of the central nervous system pickering and gerin it is likely that multiple converging pathways lead to hypertension psychological factors link with hypertension through the high risk behavioral environmental pathways the other pathway is constitutional disposition these dispositions are associated with psychological characteristics like poor diet obesity exercise habits smoking age etc james krantz and manuck it is important to note the bi directional association between psychological factors and behavioral environmental and constitutional factors is present roy janal and roy even in the light of substantial evidence that is in favor of these theories much of the published literature has received criticism based on methodological grounds james regardless of rigorous research and evidence at hand into the etiology of hypertension the pathogenesis of the problem is still not fully explained empirical page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population evidence in this regard is limited therefore a well designed study to explore relationship of psychological lifestyle and anthropometric factors with hypertension is warranted the decline in mortality and ailment can be forecasted as most of the psychological and lifestyle risk factors associated with the onset and progression of hypertension are modifiable and can be countered through the use of primary and secondary preventive and interventional strategies iqbal ridwan takari and mulyono roy janal and roy most risk factors of hypertension are modifiable controllable as well as preventable by health education and promotion hence timely identification of these risk factors can help to encounter the disease burden however evidence in this regard from across the globe cannot be considered ultimate for the native population as several factors can vary with ethnicity kearney whelton reynolds whelton and he there is dire need to conduct studies on risk factors of hypertension for different ethnic groups and across countries even in the presence of substantial evidence literature is still not conclusive about the comparative features of all the risk factors of hypertension the knowledge of risk factors for hypertension is largely derived from research conducted in the developed countries though psychological and behavioural and lifestyle risk factors may vary between populations and differ due to ethnic diversity this is one of the reasons that effects of psychological factors on risk of hypertension in the world still remain hotly debated kehoe wu leske and chylack researcher s irresolution about research findings from the western and european populations remain questionable in terms of applications to rest of the world multifactorial etiology and clustering of factors comorbidity explain risk of hypertension rozanski blumenthal and kaplan current research has a methodology designed to examine multiple risk factors simultaneously and in both men and women in a sample of pakistani population most of the available literature explaining risk of hypertension comes from either cross sectional or experimental studies that have mostly been carried out in the west delaney et al ramachandruni handberg and sheps already available literature on psychological risk factors of hypertension has revealed ambivalent results among psychological risk factors anger variables anger in anger out trait anger etc were the most studied reported associations followed by anxiety depression and others defensiveness neuroticism psychopathology social networks with one reported association each chida and steptoe limited evidence exists regarding the role of stress and distress in onset and progression of hypertension ramachandruni et al prospective studies circumvent certain temporal confounds and could have been the best choice of methodology to infer the proposed psychological anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors of hypertension but they require sustained funding and follow up over a period of at least several years as a result one of the methodologies best suited to address the impact of psychological factors on hypertension has contributed less than of the empirical work in this area the time cost and expenses involved in a prospective longitudinal study were beyond the scope of this research justification and likely benefits this study focuses on multifactorial assessment of risk factors prevalent within the pakistani population identification of these multiple risk factors can help in planning and designing primary and secondary preventive approaches to combat growing epidemic of hypertension within pakistan preventive approaches are cost effective and can help to reduce the medical cost and disease burden for pakistan a country that has limited economic resources and health budget is extremely low objectives to date assessment of risk factors for hypertension has hardly been given due attention in pakistan moreover many psychological factors like stress and distress have never been investigated within the native population the aim of this study is to assess whether perceived psychological stress distress anthropometric measurements body mass index and waist hip ratio lifestyle factors history of smoking and physical activity and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension are significantly associated with the risk of page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population primary hypertension the aim of our research is to assess multi factorial risk assessment of hypertension among a sample of pakistani population hypotheses high levels of perceived stress and distress will predict hypertension as compared to low levels of perceived stress and distress greater bmi greater than kg m will predict hypertension as compared to low bmi less than kg m high whr abdominal obesity will predict hypertension as compared to low whr physical activity of less than hours per week will predict hypertension as compared to physical activity of greater than hours per week being a smoker will predict hypertension as compared to being an ex smoker or non smoker presence of family history of hypertension before the age of in blood relatives as compared to absence of family history of hypertension will predict hypertension research design method case control research design was employed for the present study sampling strategy a purposive sampling strategy was employed to conduct the study because the sample was selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria sample to investigate the association of the aforesaid factors with risk of hypertension and to find whether these factors differ between cases and the controls we solicited a sample of patients with confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and controls who were free of hypertension before and at the time of testing cases with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension by doctors on mg and currently taking medicines both male and female aged between to years were included in this research controls selected were community based they were either visitors or non blood relatives of the cases diagnosed with

smoking was obtained that included smoking status current ex smoker and non smoker for smokers who reported smoking cigarettes further information regarding age at which smoking was started and number of cigarettes smoked per day was obtained current smokers were defined as individuals who smoked cigarettes or beedis homemade traditional cigarette in the past year months ex smokers were defined as individuals who had given up smoking more than a year ago non smokers were defined as those who do not smoke at present and have never smoked in the past a similar criterion has been employed in other studies carried out on the pakistan population nishtar et al translation of assessment scales permission for translation and use of instruments for conducting present study was appropriately sought from authors of all the scales to ensure a rigorous process of translation as well as to achieve equivalence between the original version and translated versions of scales vallerand s steps for instrument translation with slight modification were employed wongsri cantwell and archer these steps have found to decreased risks of errors and improved the precision of translation the first step involved forward translation from english version into urdu each and every one amongst the three translators had prior experience of translating questionnaires and were knowledgeable about content of the questionnaire and had substantial experience in using likert type scales during the second step rating of translated scale items by native experts was carried out all translations obtained after the forward translation procedure were rated by two bilingual native speakers step involved an item by item review of the three translations in a panel discussion comprising of three members the final target version of the translation was produced after comprehensive discussion by the members of the panel problematic items for which a mutual consensus was not reached by the members of previous panel discussion were taken up by another voluntary panel that comprised of three new members after the second panel discussion a final draft of comprehensive target translation the forward translation based on mutual agreement on item wise review was produced this final draft was given to an expert in urdu language the proof read draft thus finalized was then backward translated by three blind translators who were known language experts with established competence in english as well as urdu language a panel of three bilingual experts was formulated to review similarities and differences between the original english version of the scales and the back translated version final draft of the consensus translation was produced following agreement by all the members of the designated panel on all items procedure an institutionalized consent was sought from regulatory and ethics committee of the hospitals before starting the research sample was gathered from six hospitals all over pakistan after explaining the purpose of the study to the page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani

discussion distress was found to be a significant predictor of hypertension similar evidence has been endorsed by other researches chronic raise in negative affect elevates blood pressure many psychological factors stress anger anxiety hostility depression lack of social support and type a behavior pattern have been associated with risk of hypertension jonas and lando kamarck polk sutton tyrrell and muldoon studies have endorsed a hypertension risk difference of almost between high psychological distress and low psychological distress groups rutledge brenda and hogan our study findings seem to be in line with the evidence gained from countries the interheart study these researchers found a significant relationship between distress and hypertension rosengren et al distress through behavioural pathway can lead to hypertension distress directly affects dietary habits and health seeking behaviours both in humans and animals greeno and wing studies have found that distress hinders performance of global health behaviours wiebe and mccallum and decreases the use of positive health behaviours such as exercise and proper diet lindquist beilin and knuiman consequently it increases use of maladaptive health behaviours like consumption of food rich in fats smoking and excessive use of alcohol it has been understood that distress can result in priority change in health promoting behaviours as other matters may become the center of attention griffin friend eitel and lobel explored was stress there is likely to be difference in stress and distress that needs to be emphasized as scientific community many a times uses the term interchangeably distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg nrc stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being stress did not turn out to be a significant risk factor of hypertension within the pakistani sample several studies have emphasized stress to be a significant predictor of hypertension nishtar et al evidence accrued that cardiovascular reactivity to stress is characterized by recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity that is likely to up regulate basal blood pressure levels over time laboratory research suggests that during periods of mental stress nerve firing increases ramachandruni et al and raises levels of catecholamine s serotonin hr heart rate and bp blood pressure schwartz et al changes like raised levels of circulatory page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline termed as the adrenaline hypotheses play a significant role in onset and progression of hypertension floras major reason for the disparity in the study results can be attributed to the fact that evidence of stress as a risk factor of hypertension mostly exists from prospective cohort studies greater than year follow up everson et al likewise methodological protocols sample size and sampling strategy use of instruments to assess study variables employed by these researchers are quite dissimilar to that adopted in our study prospective studies of psychological factors on blood pressure can offer a means of evading certain temporal confounds and need unrelenting funding and follow up over a period of at least a number of years critical flaw in the argument that psychological factors play a role in the development of hypertension is the relative absence of prospective data pickering and gerin differences in definition of hypertension eg vs mm hg use of clinic based vs ambulatory blood pressure measurement methods appropriate control for covariates ie multivariate vs univariate leads to differences in identification of risk factors jonas and lando results studies that have investigated psychological risk factors have not tried to explain the potential mechanisms involved in onset of hypertension everson et al scales previously used to infer psychological factors of hypertension are mostly whose psychometric properties are often not established they contain few items that often lacking independent validation james mostly studies conducted on risk factors of hypertension have taken psychological factors as secondary to the already host of non modifiable traditional factors like age gender and family history of hypertension however in our study both scales to measure distresses as well as stress have well established psychometric properties these original scales were translated into urdu language and there psychometric properties were determined through the process of validation among traditional non modifiable risk factors gender was found to be a significant risk factor of hypertension in our sample females compared to males were found to be at a greater risk for hypertension more women are found to be hypertensive and earlier than men jafary levey and jafar pmrc the differences in gender for the prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases remain large in countries across the globe zhang sasaki and kesteloot some differences in risk factors for hypertension between women and men in rural bihar ghosh sarkar mukherji and pal and assam india have been identified hazarika biswas narain kalita and mahanta differences in hypertension prevalence by region and income in some places men have higher prevalence while in others women do have been identified in a cross sectional survey conducted on low income settlement in the city of karachi lahore the overall prevalence of hypertension was the prevalence among males was higher than females safdar omair faisal and hasan we gathered our study sample from the city of lahore punjab and risk of hypertension was found to be greater in women compared to men women in punjab compared to men are more obese overweight less physical activity being overweight and physically inactive ghosh et al zhang sasaki and kesteloot this could be a reason why women were found to be more hypertensive in our sample recruited from lahore situated in the province of punjab obesity and lack of physical activity are independent predictors of hypertension sims body mass index as a combined result from total calorie intake physical activity and genetic factors play an important role in determining the level of blood pressure individually and between populations hardoon et al smoking family history of hypertension and lack of useful level of physical activity of less than four hours were found to be other significant risk factors of hypertension obesity physical inactivity and smoking are established risk factors for hypertension ahmad ahmad zulfiqar jan and rehman hardoon et al smoking page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population obesity and physical inactivity are higher in people with elevated psychological stress and in those diagnosed with hypertension everson et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts increased prevalence of hypertension itself is related to weight gain cordon clark mueller and hovis however neither increased bmi nor whr turned out to be significant risk factors of hypertension in our research research evidence exists from a long term prospective study men who were overweight or obese in early adulthood or middle age were at higher risk of hypertension later in life overweight or obese men were consistently at higher risk of hypertension across the entire period of follow up obesity in young adulthood conferred a fold risk of hypertension shihab et al bmi does not distinguish between weight associated with muscle and weight associated with fat and the relationship between bmi and body fat content varies according to body build and proportion garrow furthermore bmi cannot make a discrepancy between fat and muscle mass ashwell in contrast the measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect changes in hypertension and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and other forms of chronic diseases is better than bmi whr as a measure of risk of hypertension and other diseases has been recently challenged to due to several reasons first hip circumference cannot be obtained routinely and the measure is more difficult to perform and less reliable second whr is not useful in practical risk management as the ratio could remain constant when the weight of individual increases or decreases ashwell wang in future studies need to be designed by considering measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect a precise association with hypertension moreover intervention trials in which participants are selected on the basis of high standing on one or more factors epitomize an additional avenue for likely future research delaney et al the need is to conduct prospective studies for improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship of obesity bmi and whr with blood pressure to sum up the results of our study provide statistical support for the proposed relationship between psychological non modifiable factors and risk of hypertension the status of psychological factors as a clinically important risk factor for high blood pressure appears promising but additional research potentially including prospective longitudinal and intervention trials will be necessary to further infer this prediction mechanisms explaining this potential relationship remain speculative and should continue to be a focus of research among behavioral medicine investigators the inclusion of multiple samplings adds yet another layer of difficulty to prospective studies but the probable benefits of improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship between psychological factors and blood pressure may be important enough to motivate us to overcome this obstacle research must go further by actively proposing and testing meditational relationships that will better allow us to assess potential mechanisms in these relationships nearly all studies to date derived their estimates of psychological effects on hypertension from a single point estimate of psychological functioning there is evidence to indicate that many personality characteristics are relatively stable over long intervals other psychological characteristics such as depression are known to fluctuate limitations the findings of our study are susceptible to an inability to control for competing explanations for example the possibility that alternative mechanisms genetic or environmental could dispose both psychological characteristics and hypertension risk that blood pressure increases may precede rather than follow psychological factors may similarly serve as a non causal marker for disease onset and progression and are among the most frequently cited shortcomings by other researchers too krantz and manuck pickering and gerin in spite of certain limitations the study highlights a need to move beyond the conventional approaches to assess traditional factors associated with the risk of primary hypertension moreover this study draws attention towards call for assessment of psychological risk factors like distress along with assessment of traditional modifiable anthropometric and lifestyle and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension this page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population study also provides direction for designing primary and secondary preventive approaches based on identified psychological anthropometric lifestyle and traditional risk factors present within the pakistani population preventive approaches to counter the growing epidemic of hypertension need to focus on creating awareness regarding smoking as a risk factor for hypertension preventive strategies should target at creating awareness towards increasing the level of physical activity to four or more hours per week timely psychological management of distress needs to be highlighted as distress has found to predict hypertension public should be made aware of the fact that women as well as families who have a blood relative with hypertension before the age of are at a greater risk for hypertension last but not the least the study endorses directions for prospective longitudinal research research potentially including intervention trials will be necessary to further shed light on this issue conclusion to prevent an epidemic of cardiovascular disease in pakistan hypertension control by screening treatment and primary prevention of identified risk factors will be an important task for physicians public health professionals psychologists and health policy makers in pakistan

december thursday copyright kohat university of science and technology all rights reserved section vol no length words byline wafa munir ansari abdul khaliq naveed and dilshad ahmed khan body introduction premature coronary artery disease pcad occurs as the foremost effect of coronary atherosclerosis premature cad is defined as stenosis in at least one vessel on coronary angiography in patients less than years of age timely detection and effective management are the key factors for the effective management of pcad one of the major events in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression in cad is inflammation multiple pro inflammatory and anti inflammatory cytokines play an active role in early atherosclerosis interleukin il is one of the key players in the modulation of immunological and inflammatory processes during various stages of premature coronary artery disease il is an inflammatory cytokine which actively takes part in the immune inflammatory process underlying the pathogenesis of cad the hereditability of il has been estimated to be about but still to date only a limited number of gene polymorphisms affecting il levels are known the most widely studied of these is the g c variant in the il gene promoter region while some studies have reported significant association of g c single nucleotide polymorphism with cad others have demonstrated no association between them keeping in view the role of il in the pathogenesis of cad it is being considered as a potential target for drug therapy because it has been seen that individuals with variants in il gene that hampers the il pathway were found to be at a reduced risk for coronary heart disease there is still paucity of studies reporting the potential effect of the il gene promoter snp g c rs on the serum il levels and the risk prediction of cad in premature coronary artery disease patients of pakistan hence we sought to assess the role of the il gene promoter snp g c rs and il serum levels in the diagnosis and risk prediction of pcad patients methods this was a case control study carried out at the chemical pathology laboratory cpl army medical college rawalpindi along with the cardiovascular genetics institute university college london uk ethical approval was duly sought from the institutional review committee of both the concerned institutions duration of the study was from july to jan subjects three hundred and sixty four subjects aged less than years reporting to the cardiac care centre with chest pain and scheduled to have angiography were recruited consecutively out of these patients who had greater than blockade in at least one coronary artery diagnosed angiographically were selected as cases those who were angiographically free from the disease or had less than stenosis in a single coronary artery page of influence of interleukin g c single nucleotide polymorphism on serum il levels in premature coronary artery disease were selected as controls n cases who had previously been diagnosed with any blood disorder carcinoma renal congenital heart disease hepatitis liver or thyroid disease or any acute infection were excluded demographic characteristics along with ethnicity were noted subjects were explained the process in detail and informed consent was taken in written form the procedures adopted comply with the ethical standards of helsinki declaration of biochemical analysis blood samples were taken on the day which was scheduled for angiography of the respective patient preferably early in the morning ten millilitre blood sample was obtained by venipuncture ml was transferred to a red top serum tube for serum analysis and ml transferred to edta tube for dna extraction enzyme linked immunosorbent assay elisa technique was used for measuring the concentrations of serum il duo set kit randd systems commercial kit using human monoclonal antibodies the coefficient of variation cv intra assay for il was while the limit of detection was less than ng dl respectively genomic dna was extracted using the qiaamp dna blood mini kit qiagen genotyping was carried out using taqman assay using the standard assay protocol at the cardiovascular genetics institute university college london uk for each taqman genotyping assay there is a forward primer and a reverse primer which bind sequences either side of the snp to be genotyped allowing amplification of the region during pcr there are two allele specific probes labeled with a different fluorophore vic or fam at the end at the end is a quencher which prevents fluorophore from fluorescing during the process if only one fluorophore fluoresces the sample is homozygous for the corresponding allele if a signal from both fluorophores is present the sample is heterozygous the components when using taqman buffer are shown in table ul of the reaction mix was added per well the plate was then centrifuged and the pcr performed using the for taqman genotyping assays as below c for minutes c for minutes c for sec c for minute the intensity of each single nucleotide polymorphism snp was based on the criteria of three clear clusters in two scales generated by sequence detection systems sds software version abi statistical analysis statistical analysis was done by spss spss inc chicago and medcalc software version mean sd median was calculated for descriptive statistics mann whitney u test was applied for comparison of pcad patients and controls medcalc software was used to construct receiver operator characteristic curve roc to estimate the diagnostic value and diagnostic odds ratio of il genotype of g c and allele frequencies were measured by the chi square and fisher exact test respectively to evaluate possible relationship of g c polymorphism and increased il levels with pcad binary logistic regression analysis was carried out a p value of less than qualified as significant results total subjects consisting of pcad patients

artery disease c in the current study il promoter region polymorphism g c was significantly related to pcad and it remained significant in multivariate analysis even after accounting for the confounding variables minor allele c at g c was associated with high serum il levels to date allele frequency information across pakistan and even in south asia is limited for the snps moreover the information that is available has conflicting results and there is marked variation in the risk allele frequencies of these risk snps in different populations while some studies have marked c as the risk allele others have demonstrated gg to be the genotype conferring the risk of cad this is likely caused by the presence of population sub structure another probable explanation may be that the functional snp in the il is yet to be identified with g c being the tagging snp in certain populations where significant association has not been observed on performing logistic regression analysis after adjusting for the confounding variables an independent association was found between pcad and raised serum il levels and cc genotype of g c polymorphism this is an important observation because a previous study demonstrates that il may have a limited role in predicting early mortality in cad and its performance may be limited by age related factors whereas other studies have shown that interleukin concentrations and il gene promoter snp g c aid in the prognostic risk stratification of these cad patients we observed significant correlation of serum il levels with the extent of blockade in pcad patients this has been previously observed in a study where there was a positive association between the atherosclerotic burden and serum il level this is probably because of the pro atherogenic nature of il and its distinctive role in macrophage polarization and other stages of inflammation in atherosclerosis serum il levels also correlated significantly with the bmi in pcad patients this may be due to il altering the resistance to insulin in an individual this correlation has been reported in a previous study in overweight post menopausal women another study suggests that il may be secreted in relation to the increase in fat deposit resulting in a positive correlation with bmi and total cholesterol as far as the correlation between smoking and il is concerned a moderate positive correlation between il and smoking load has been demonstrated earlier one of the probable explanations for this may be that the cigarette smoke activates alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells to release inflammatory mediators leading to increase in the oxidative stress through stimulatory effects on the acute phase response table vi correlation of serum interleukin level

included angio negative subjects as disease free controls for a better comparison it is also the first kind of its study which has studied the diagnostic accuracy of il in pcad patients who are young and whose number is increasing alarmingly in pakistan and south asia moreover we have identified a cut off value for serum il level with the best possible sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis and risk stratification of pcad the possible limitation of our study is its relatively limited sample size future research endeavors should also include acute coronary syndrome cases of pcad for a better assessment of the diagnostic efficacy of il and the role of il g c snp in pcad patients conclusion page of influence of interleukin g c single nucleotide polymorphism on serum il levels in

lifestyle and anthropometric correlates of hypertension the objective of the study is to find out whether high level of stress distress bmi greater than kg m and high whr waist hip ratio lack of useful level of physical activity smoking cigarettes presence of family history of hypertension are likely to predict hypertension to conduct this study seventy eight n cases with diagnosis of hypertension aged between to years and n community matched controls were recruited through purposive sampling technique to measure psychological factors the perceived stress scale by cohen kamarck and mermelstein and kessler psychological distress scale developed by kessler andrews and colpe were used waist hip ratio and body mass index were calculated with the help of height waist hip circumference and weight measurements information regarding smoking status and frequency and duration of physical activity was ascertained information sheet was constructed to gather demographic and medical information binary logistic regression analysis model revealed that women current smokers and those having a family history of hypertension were at a risk for hypertension high level of distress and absence of four or more hours of physical activity per week were significant predictors for hypertension in order to circumvent certain temporal confounds we propose prospective longitudinal and interventional studies to be carried out in the future keywords psychological stress distress anthropometric lifestyle hypertension hypertension commonly known as high blood pressure continues to be a foremost public health concern for pakistan though the cause may not be known research endorses that primary hypertension is associated with a number of factors genetic behavioral environmental or a psychological in pakistan there are an estimated million people facing this condition in pakistan among them million men and million are women hypertension affects one in three individuals over the age of years nishtar et al and prevalence of high bp is one in three over the age of years prevalence among pakistani females is lower compared to males however it exceeds after the age group of years pakistan medical research council pmrc prevalence clinical repercussions and medical costs linked with hypertension points towards a clinical emergency that needs prompt attention of researchers and clinical health experts siegler peterson barefoot and williams risk factors associated with hypertension fall in three categories a physiological eg coronary artery

other established lifestyle risk factors for hypertension hardoon et al siegler et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts sims carroll phillips gale and batty the pathogenesis of obesity related hypertension can be understood in the light of the activation of the sympathetic nervous system obesity is associated with increased blood flow vasodilatation cardiac output and hypertension the factors that contribute in onset of hypertension due to obesity include enhanced sympathetic tone activation of the renin angiotensin system ras hyperinsulinemia structural changes in the kidney and elaboration of adipokines hormones produced in fat itself such as leptin rahman and ahmad besides relationship between behavioral risk factors negative affect has also found to be a risk for hypertension allison et al researchers have endorsed that risk of hypertension due to anger anxiety and depression is comparable to that of obesity and lack of physical activity chida and steptoe studies examining the association of hypertension with psychological distress such as anxiety and depressive symptoms have produced mixed findings few studies have reported positive associations patten et al carroll et al while others have found a weak delaney et al or no associations yan et al studies highlight that stress may not directly cause hypertension but it can lead to repeated blood pressure elevations which eventually may lead to hypertension mousa yousef riccardo zeidan and sabatinelli the terms stress and distress cannot be used interchangeably there is likely to be a difference in stress and distress that needs to be accentuated distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being nrc research validates that biological and behavioral pathways link psychological factors to an increased risk of hypertension shihab et al psychological factors have found to associate with long term blood pressure and the evidence dates back to as far as the early th century alexander theories regarding mechanisms for this probable relationship reveal that psychological factors like prolong stress anxiety depression anger hostility etc can directly alter physiological process leading to hypertension altered physiological processes that have found to increase the risk of hypertension include vascular and endothelial changes increased sympathetic tone baroreflex sensitivity vascular stiffness bp variability and central opiodergic mechanisms kaplan pettersson manuck and olsson cardiovascular reactivity which is a recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity up regulates basal blood pressure levels matthews woodall and allen neuro hormonal models point out that psychological factors like stress distress anger etc may precipitate development of hypertension as they modify functioning of the central nervous system pickering and gerin it is likely that multiple converging pathways lead to hypertension psychological factors link with hypertension through the high risk behavioral environmental pathways the other pathway is constitutional disposition these dispositions are associated with psychological characteristics like poor diet obesity exercise habits smoking age etc james krantz and manuck it is important to note the bi directional association between psychological factors and behavioral environmental and constitutional factors is present roy janal and roy even in the light of substantial evidence that is in favor of these theories much of the published literature has received criticism based on methodological grounds james regardless of rigorous research and evidence at hand into the etiology of hypertension the pathogenesis of the problem is still not fully explained empirical page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population evidence in this regard is limited therefore a well designed study to explore relationship of psychological lifestyle and anthropometric factors with hypertension is warranted the decline in mortality and ailment can be forecasted as most of the psychological and lifestyle risk factors associated with the onset and progression of hypertension are modifiable and can be countered through the use of primary and secondary preventive and interventional strategies iqbal ridwan takari and mulyono roy janal and roy most risk factors of hypertension are modifiable controllable as well as preventable by health education and promotion hence timely identification of these risk factors can help to encounter the disease burden however evidence in this regard from across the globe cannot be considered ultimate for the native population as several factors can vary with ethnicity kearney whelton reynolds whelton and he there is dire need to conduct studies on risk factors of hypertension for different ethnic groups and across countries even in the presence of substantial evidence literature is still not conclusive about the comparative features of all the risk factors of hypertension the knowledge of risk factors for hypertension is largely derived from research conducted in the developed countries though psychological and behavioural and lifestyle risk factors may vary between populations and differ due to ethnic diversity this is one of the reasons that effects of psychological factors on risk of hypertension in the world still remain hotly debated kehoe wu leske and chylack researcher s irresolution about research findings from the western and european populations remain questionable in terms of applications to rest of the world multifactorial etiology and clustering of factors comorbidity explain risk of hypertension rozanski blumenthal and kaplan current research has a methodology designed to examine multiple risk factors simultaneously and in both men and women in a sample of pakistani population most of the available literature explaining risk of hypertension comes from either cross sectional or experimental studies that have mostly been carried out in the west delaney et al ramachandruni handberg and sheps already available literature on psychological risk factors of hypertension has revealed ambivalent results among psychological risk factors anger variables anger in anger out trait anger etc were the most studied reported associations followed by anxiety depression and others defensiveness neuroticism psychopathology social networks with one reported association each chida and steptoe limited evidence exists regarding the role of stress and distress in onset and progression of hypertension ramachandruni et al prospective studies circumvent certain temporal confounds and could have been the best choice of methodology to infer the proposed psychological anthropometric and lifestyle risk factors of hypertension but they require sustained funding and follow up over a period of at least several years as a result one of the methodologies best suited to address the impact of psychological factors on hypertension has contributed less than of the empirical work in this area the time cost and expenses involved in a prospective longitudinal study were beyond the scope of this research justification and likely benefits this study focuses on multifactorial assessment of risk factors prevalent within the pakistani population identification of these multiple risk factors can help in planning and designing primary and secondary preventive approaches to combat growing epidemic of hypertension within pakistan preventive approaches are cost effective and can help to reduce the medical cost and disease burden for pakistan a country that has limited economic resources and health budget is extremely low objectives to date assessment of risk factors for hypertension has hardly been given due attention in pakistan moreover many psychological factors like stress and distress have never been investigated within the native population the aim of this study is to assess whether perceived psychological stress distress anthropometric measurements body mass index and waist hip ratio lifestyle factors history of smoking and physical activity and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension are significantly associated with the risk of page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population primary hypertension the aim of our research is to assess multi factorial risk assessment of hypertension among a sample of pakistani population hypotheses high levels of perceived stress and distress will predict hypertension as compared to low levels of perceived stress and distress greater bmi greater than kg m will predict hypertension as compared to low bmi less than kg m high whr abdominal obesity will predict hypertension as compared to low whr physical activity of less than hours per week will predict hypertension as compared to physical activity of greater than hours per week being a smoker will predict hypertension as compared to being an ex smoker or non smoker presence of family history of hypertension before the age of in blood relatives as compared to absence of family history of hypertension will predict hypertension research design method case control research design was employed for the present study sampling strategy a purposive sampling strategy was employed to conduct the study because the sample was selected on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria sample to investigate the association of the aforesaid factors with risk of hypertension and to find whether these factors differ between cases and the controls we solicited a sample of patients with confirmed diagnosis of hypertension and controls who were free of hypertension before and at the time of testing cases with a confirmed diagnosis of hypertension by doctors on mg and currently taking medicines both male and female aged between to years were included in this research controls selected were community based they were either visitors or non blood relatives of the cases diagnosed with hypertension matched for age and

a useful level of physically activity is four or more hours of physical activity per week frequency and duration of physical activity was ascertained this criterion for useful level of physical activity has previously been adopted by many studies conducted to unearth lifestyle risk factors for hypertension patten et al rosengren et al smoking the information regarding smoking was obtained that included smoking status current ex smoker and non smoker for smokers who reported smoking cigarettes further information regarding age at which smoking was started and number of cigarettes smoked per day was obtained current smokers were defined as individuals who smoked cigarettes or beedis homemade traditional cigarette in the past year months ex smokers were defined as individuals who had given up smoking more than a year ago non smokers were defined as those who do not smoke at present and have never smoked in the past a similar criterion has been employed in other studies carried out on the pakistan population nishtar et al translation of assessment scales permission for translation and use of instruments for conducting present study was appropriately sought from authors of all the scales to ensure a rigorous process of translation as well as to achieve equivalence between the original version and translated versions of scales vallerand s steps for instrument translation with slight modification were employed wongsri cantwell and archer these steps have found to decreased risks of errors and improved the precision of translation the first step involved forward translation from english version into urdu each and every one amongst the three translators had prior experience of translating questionnaires and were knowledgeable about content of the questionnaire and had substantial experience in using likert type scales during the second step rating of translated scale items by native experts was carried out all translations obtained after the forward translation procedure were rated by two bilingual native speakers step involved an item by item review of the three translations in a panel discussion comprising of three members the final target version of the translation was produced after comprehensive discussion by the members of the panel problematic items for which a mutual consensus was not reached by the members of previous panel discussion were taken up by another voluntary panel that comprised of three new members after the second panel discussion a final draft of comprehensive target translation the forward translation based on mutual agreement on item wise review was produced this final draft was given to an expert in urdu language the proof read draft thus finalized was then backward translated by three blind translators who were known language experts with established competence in english as well as urdu language a panel of three bilingual experts was formulated to review similarities and differences between the original english version of the scales and the back translated version final draft of the consensus translation was produced following agreement by all the members of the designated panel

discussion distress was found to be a significant predictor of hypertension similar evidence has been endorsed by other researches chronic raise in negative affect elevates blood pressure many psychological factors stress anger anxiety hostility depression lack of social support and type a behavior pattern have been associated with risk of hypertension jonas and lando kamarck polk sutton tyrrell and muldoon studies have endorsed a hypertension risk difference of almost between high psychological distress and low psychological distress groups rutledge brenda and hogan our study findings seem to be in line with the evidence gained from countries the interheart study these researchers found a significant relationship between distress and hypertension rosengren et al distress through behavioural pathway can lead to hypertension distress directly affects dietary habits and health seeking behaviours both in humans and animals greeno and wing studies have found that distress hinders performance of global health behaviours wiebe and mccallum and decreases the use of positive health behaviours such as exercise and proper diet lindquist beilin and knuiman consequently it increases use of maladaptive health behaviours like consumption of food rich in fats smoking and excessive use of alcohol it has been understood that distress can result in priority change in health promoting behaviours as other matters may become the center of attention griffin friend eitel and lobel explored was stress there is likely to be difference in stress and distress that needs to be emphasized as scientific community many a times uses the term interchangeably distress is usually defined as an aversive negative states traits resulting in failure of coping and adaptation processes leading to physiological and or psychological homeostasis carstens and moberg nrc stress denotes a real or perceived discomposure to an organism s physiological homeostasis or psychological well being stress did not turn out to be a significant risk factor of hypertension within the pakistani sample several studies have emphasized stress to be a significant predictor of hypertension nishtar et al evidence accrued that cardiovascular reactivity to stress is characterized by recurrent pattern of exaggerated sympathetic nervous system activity that is likely to up regulate basal blood pressure levels over time laboratory research suggests that during periods of mental stress nerve firing increases ramachandruni et al and raises levels of catecholamine s serotonin hr heart rate and bp blood pressure schwartz et al changes like raised levels of circulatory page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline termed as the adrenaline hypotheses play a significant role in onset and progression of hypertension floras major reason for the disparity in the study results can be attributed to the fact that evidence of stress as a risk factor of hypertension mostly exists from prospective cohort studies greater than year follow up everson et al likewise methodological protocols sample size and sampling strategy use of instruments to assess study variables employed by these researchers are quite dissimilar to that adopted in our study prospective studies of psychological factors on blood pressure can offer a means of evading certain temporal confounds and need unrelenting funding and follow up over a period of at least a number of years critical flaw in the argument that psychological factors play a role in the development of hypertension is the relative absence of prospective data pickering and gerin differences in definition of hypertension eg vs mm hg use of clinic based vs ambulatory blood pressure measurement methods appropriate control for covariates ie multivariate vs univariate leads to differences in identification of risk factors jonas and lando results studies that have investigated psychological risk factors have not tried to explain the potential mechanisms involved in onset of hypertension everson et al scales previously used to infer psychological factors of hypertension are mostly whose psychometric properties are often not established they contain few items that often lacking independent validation james mostly studies conducted on risk factors of hypertension have taken psychological factors as secondary to the already host of non modifiable traditional factors like age gender and family history of hypertension however in our study both scales to measure distresses as well as stress have well established psychometric properties these original scales were translated into urdu language and there psychometric properties were determined through the process of validation among traditional non modifiable risk factors gender was found to be a significant risk factor of hypertension in our sample females compared to males were found to be at a greater risk for hypertension more women are found to be hypertensive and earlier than men jafary levey and jafar pmrc the differences in gender for the prevalence of hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases remain large in countries across the globe zhang sasaki and kesteloot some differences in risk factors for hypertension between women and men in rural bihar ghosh sarkar mukherji and pal and assam india have been identified hazarika biswas narain kalita and mahanta differences in hypertension prevalence by region and income in some places men have higher prevalence while in others women do have been identified in a cross sectional survey conducted on low income settlement in the city of karachi lahore the overall prevalence of hypertension was the prevalence among males was higher than females safdar omair faisal and hasan we gathered our study sample from the city of lahore punjab and risk of hypertension was found to be greater in women compared to men women in punjab compared to men are more obese overweight less physical activity being overweight and physically inactive ghosh et al zhang sasaki and kesteloot this could be a reason why women were found to be more hypertensive in our sample recruited from lahore situated in the province of punjab obesity and lack of physical activity are independent predictors of hypertension sims body mass index as a combined result from total calorie intake physical activity and genetic factors play an important role in determining the level of blood pressure individually and between populations hardoon et al smoking family history of hypertension and lack of useful level of physical activity of less than four hours were found to be other significant risk factors of hypertension obesity physical inactivity and smoking are established risk factors for hypertension ahmad ahmad zulfiqar jan and rehman hardoon et al smoking page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population obesity and physical inactivity are higher in people with elevated psychological stress and in those diagnosed with hypertension everson et al individuals who are obese have a twofold chance of getting hypertensive as compared to their non obese counterparts increased prevalence of hypertension itself is related to weight gain cordon clark mueller and hovis however neither increased bmi nor whr turned out to be significant risk factors of hypertension in our research research evidence exists from a long term prospective study men who were overweight or obese in early adulthood or middle age were at higher risk of hypertension later in life overweight or obese men were consistently at higher risk of hypertension across the entire period of follow up obesity in young adulthood conferred a fold risk of hypertension shihab et al bmi does not distinguish between weight associated with muscle and weight associated with fat and the relationship between bmi and body fat content varies according to body build and proportion garrow furthermore bmi cannot make a discrepancy between fat and muscle mass ashwell in contrast the measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect changes in hypertension and risk factors for cardiovascular diseases and other forms of chronic diseases is better than bmi whr as a measure of risk of hypertension and other diseases has been recently challenged to due to several reasons first hip circumference cannot be obtained routinely and the measure is more difficult to perform and less reliable second whr is not useful in practical risk management as the ratio could remain constant when the weight of individual increases or decreases ashwell wang in future studies need to be designed by considering measure of intra abdominal or central fat accumulation to reflect a precise association with hypertension moreover intervention trials in which participants are selected on the basis of high standing on one or more factors epitomize an additional avenue for likely future research delaney et al the need is to conduct prospective studies for improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship of obesity bmi and whr with blood pressure to sum up the results of our study provide statistical support for the proposed relationship between psychological non modifiable factors and risk of hypertension the status of psychological factors as a clinically important risk factor for high blood pressure appears promising but additional research potentially including prospective longitudinal and intervention trials will be necessary to further infer this prediction mechanisms explaining this potential relationship remain speculative and should continue to be a focus of research among behavioral medicine investigators the inclusion of multiple samplings adds yet another layer of difficulty to prospective studies but the probable benefits of improved reliability and a better understanding of the temporal relationship between psychological factors and blood pressure may be important enough to motivate us to overcome this obstacle research must go further by actively proposing and testing meditational relationships that will better allow us to assess potential mechanisms in these relationships nearly all studies to date derived their estimates of psychological effects on hypertension from a single point estimate of psychological functioning there is evidence to indicate that many personality characteristics are relatively stable over long intervals other psychological characteristics such as depression are known to fluctuate limitations the findings of our study are susceptible to an inability to control for competing explanations for example the possibility that alternative mechanisms genetic or environmental could dispose both psychological characteristics and hypertension risk that blood pressure increases may precede rather than follow psychological factors may similarly serve as a non causal marker for disease onset and progression and are among the most frequently cited shortcomings by other researchers too krantz and manuck pickering and gerin in spite of certain limitations the study highlights a need to move beyond the conventional approaches to assess traditional factors associated with the risk of primary hypertension moreover this study draws attention towards call for assessment of psychological risk factors like distress along with assessment of traditional modifiable anthropometric and lifestyle and non modifiable factors age gender and family history of hypertension this page of psychological stress distress anthropometric and lifestyle as correlates of hypertension in a sample of pakistani population study also provides direction for designing primary and secondary preventive approaches based on identified psychological anthropometric lifestyle and traditional risk factors present within the pakistani population preventive approaches to counter the growing epidemic of hypertension need to focus on creating awareness regarding smoking as a risk factor for hypertension preventive strategies should target at creating awareness towards increasing the level of physical activity to four or more hours per week timely psychological management of distress needs to be highlighted as distress has found to predict hypertension public should be made aware of the fact that women as well as families who have a blood relative with hypertension before the age of are at a greater risk for hypertension last but not the least the study endorses directions for prospective longitudinal research research potentially including intervention trials will be necessary to further shed light on this issue conclusion to prevent an epidemic of cardiovascular disease in pakistan hypertension control by screening treatment and primary prevention of identified risk factors will be an important task for physicians public health professionals psychologists and health policy makers in pakistan

sanjay kalra body abstract exclusive breastfeeding for six months continued along with top feed up to the age of years and beyond is strongly recommended by the world health organization apart from the various benefits that it provides breast feeding may also serve to prevent the development of type diabetes and metabolic syndrome in mothers and type diabetes and overweight obesity in their offspring this review discusses the evidence related to breastfeeding and type diabetes it highlights pertinent aspects of breast feeding management which can help facilitate optimal use of this natural preventive intervention keywords type diabetes type diabetes metabolic syndrome prevention lactation introduction breast feeding is an essential component of post partum management this becomes even more important when pregnancy has been complicated by diabetes mellitus breast feeding has been found to confer multiple health benefits to both infant and mother in women with gestational diabetes mellitus gdm breast feeding has been reported to reduce the development of metabolic syndrome while in their offspring it decreases the risk of becoming overweight or obese exclusive breast feeding is also associated with a reduced incidence of type and type diabetes mellitus all members of the gdm care team should be aware of these benefits however there exist various bio psychosocial barriers and challenges to breast feeding initiation these need to be identified and resolved through a comprehensive approach involving not only the patient but her family members as well evidence and mechanism of action the evidence related to breast feeding and gdm has collated and discussed by much et al and gunderson et al in detail while earlier studies showed no association between breast feeding and the development of type diabetes in women with gdm recent studies have demonstrated the protective effect of lactation on metabolic parameters breast feeding improves metabolic function by various mechanisms table in postpartum women with gdm breast feeding has been shown to improve glucose tolerance in women who breast fed their offspring for minutes during an ogtt post challenge glucose levels fell significantly as compared to those mothers who did not feed their babies during the course of ogtt table postulated mechanisms by which breast feeding improves

may reduce stress status of breast feeding in gdm women with history of gdm especially if obese and or required insulin for treatment during pregnancy report lower rates of breast feeding initiation and earlier weaning this may be due to reduced prolactin response to suckling anatomical difficulties with large breasts a higher operative delivery rate and a higher nursery admission rate which keeps the neonate away from the mother other reasons for non initiation of breastfeed that we have encountered includes maternal fear of transmission of diabetes to the child adequacy of lactation mothers often feel that their milk production is inadequate and start early top feeds in a misguided attempt to ensure optimal nutrition for their offspring this is usually not the case women can be reassured by providing a simple checklist table which describes clinical markers of adequacy of lactation table markers of adequacy of lactation maternal history adequate maternal infant interaction during feeding drip milk from contralateral breast during feeding infant history baby satisfaction adequate sleep urine void greater than day examination investigation weight gain g day in first month breast milk na concentration less than mmol l management counselling about the benefits of breast feeding anticipated barriers and challenges and ways to overcome them should begin in the antenatal period the end of the third trimester is an appropriate time to begin such discussion doubts and myths must be explored discussed and dispelled examination of the breast is important to ensure and maintain optimal nipple and breast hygiene conditions such as retracted or cracked nipples and skin infections can be addressed prior to delivery support is important immediately after delivery baby friendly policies should be practiced in the maternity wards and breast feeding should be initiated as soon as the baby is ready to feed and the mother is well enough to suckle this should ideally be within minutes of a vaginal delivery rooming in should be encouraged and prelacteal feeds avoided adequate attention should be paid to maternal nutrition as well as maternal emotions various nutritional galactogogues are used based upon local traditions if this practice promotes family bonding and allows active involvement of the mother in law there is no harm it must be emphasized however that there is no robust evidence to support the use of any galactogogue metoclopramide in a dose of mg tds is often prescribed as a galactogogue the medication record of the postpartum mother should also be reviewed only those drugs which are safe in lactation should be prescribed in women with diabetes insulin remains the safest option during lactation glibenclamide and metformin are other options which can be tried if absolutely necessary a pragmatic approach to the use of metformin in pregnancy has already been published women with diabetes who are page of breast feeding preventive therapy for type diabetes breastfeeding should continue to avoid any medicines for the treatment of diabetes complications that were discontinued for safety reasons in the preconception period lactation for neonates in nursery for neonates who are admitted in nursery mothers may provide expressed breast milk ebm using a breast pump early institution of expression is important to avoid later complaints of inadequacy of lactation and engorgement of breast room temperature milk storage is safe for at least to hours and may be safe for up to hours when it has been expressed in a clean manner and stored in cooler room temperatures milk may be stored for at least hours refrigerated at c or less new warm milk should not be added to cooled stored milk as this could increase bacterial contamination the antibacterial activity in milk declines with increasing duration of storage expressed breast milk must be collected in a glass or plastic bowl and must not be boiled stainless steel containers should be avoided as immunoglobulins are reported to stick to steel surfaces summary breast feeding provides a natural and effective means of preventing metabolic syndrome in both women and their offspring while the benefits of breast feeding are of relevance to all postpartum women women with history of gdm and their infants are at relatively higher risk of developing dysmetabolism in later life breast feeding should therefore be promoted strongly in women with gdm as a means of improving long term health outcomes necessary encouragement support and management must be provided to ensure institution and maintenance of breast feeding in them all members of the gdm care team including endocrinologists diabetes nurses educators and dieticians should be aware of potential misconceptions related to breastfeeding they should work closely with the mother explaining the proven benefits of this process encouraging her to breastfeed and providing appropriate support where necessary we suggest a simple mnemonic table similar to one related to the post partum management of gdm to highlight and simplify breastfeeding management the points embedded in the abcde mnemonic promote comprehensive breast feeding management from antenatal to postpartum period involving all care providers while keeping the women with gdm at the centre of decision making table

control groups in response to a lifestyle intervention in borderline hypertensives the intervention was carried out for the period of three months methodology a total of adult participants were included with borderline hypertension b p between to mmhg in lahore pakistan participants were randomized into study and control groups the study group was provided with minutes daily exercise advice both written and verbal with regular monthly follow ups from may to december data were collected using a structured questionnaire blood pressures were recorded by sphygmomanometer data were analysed using spss v chi square test of significance was applied for comparison of proportions and t test for comparison of means relative risks and confidence intervals were generated results out of

systolic and diastolic blood pressures was seen in control group at the start and end of three month period conclusions physical activity can lower borderline hypertension reducing blood pressure can prevent the excess risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with borderline hypertension however a study on a large sample size is required to generalize results for wider community also a three month period for physical activity is not predictive of change in lifestyle behaviors the effect of intervention should have been evaluated after six months and one year intervals to measure long term outcomes keywords borderline hypertension physical activity sedentary life style cardiovascular disease noncommunicable diseases ncds randomized control field trial rcft blood pressure introduction according to the jnc seven classification of hypertension borderline hypertension lies between mmhg and mmhg it is not a disease category instead it is a designation chosen to identify individuals at high risk of developing hypertension there are at least million hypertension sufferers worldwide which is percent page of effect of physical activity on borderline hypertension of the total global disease burden non communicable diseases ncds contribute significantly to adult mortality and morbidity and impose a heavy economic burden on individuals society and health systems within pakistan a study done in the provinces of punjab and sindh in pakistan showed hypertension prevalence of and respectively in pakistan it is estimated that more than of the population over the age of is hypertensive similarly the prevalence of hypertension over the age of years was reported at implying that one in three pakistani nationals over the age of years suffers from high blood pressure another survey conducted in boston in us population showed similar trends with prevalence estimates of in both men and women studies have shown a strong association between elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure and the risk of cardiovascular disease and stroke according to the world heart federation fact sheet physical inactivity increases the risk of hypertension by a regular exercise program may help lower blood pressure over the long term activities such as jogging cycling or swimming for to minutes daily may ultimately lower blood pressure by as much as to mmhg this study was designed to identify the inverse association between physical activity and borderline hypertension the aim was to promote a life style change in our community if an association is found subjects and methods the study design selected was randomized control field trial rcft in the setting of the university of punjab lahore pakistan from may to december the study population was faculty members of the university of punjab lahore pakistan the faculty from all departments was listed and those with borderline hypertension fulfilling the inclusion criteria were included in the sample one hundred and two participants with borderline hypertension were identified inclusion criteria were male and female faculty members of punjab university aged years with borderline hypertension individuals with known history of co morbid conditions such as diabetes mellitus heart diseases renal diseases endocrine disorders and pulmonary diseases those on steroids therapy or other medications and known hypertensives were excluded from the study from above all those who fulfilled the inclusion criteria were stratified by age and sex figure data collection instrument was a validated questionnaire sphygmomanometer was used to record blood pressure the data were entered into the computer software program using spss version data analysis was done using the same software chi square test of significance x was applied relative risk rr and confidence intervals ci were calculated preand post intervention mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were recorded in both study and control groups t test was used to determine the difference between the means p value less than was taken as statistically significant for both statistical tests stratified randomization was done to account for gender and age figure baseline blood pressures of participants were measured the lowest reading of blood pressure was taken as final reading the data was collected using a structured questionnaire including the variable of interest the investigators conducted examinations and interviews which included measurement of blood pressure of the study participants the experimental group was provided with exercise advice both written and verbal intervention with regular monthly follow ups they were asked to do moderate regular physical exercise for three months e g daily brisk walk for minutes they were allowed to re divide minute exercise by three bouts of minute each per day the blood pressure at the end of the stipulated period of three months was recorded to see the effect of intervention during the follow up period on every visit the participants in the control group were regularly inquired about any change in their physical activity results page of effect of physical activity on borderline hypertension a randomized control field trial was conducted to see the effect of physical activity on borderline hypertension a total of borderline hypertensives were identified for the study and were randomized into study and control groups stratified randomization was done to control the confounding effect of age and gender the proportion of participants with reduction in both systolic and diastolic blood pressures in study group is highly statistically significant as compared to the proportion of subjects in the control group i e p and p table this shows that the

blood pressures in borderline hypertensives in our study out of subjects in study group a total of showed a reduction in systolic blood pressure and showed a reduction in their diastolic blood pressures as compared to only and out of in the control group table a study conducted at the university of minnesota in usa showed that physical activity should be considered in the prevention of hypertension in young adults it was found that young adults who exercised an average of five times a week and burnt calories per exercise session experienced a reduction in the risk of developing hypertension in addition study participants who maintained or increased their total time participating in physical activity from the start of the study to the finish decreased their risk of high blood pressure by for every calories they burned weekly page of effect of physical activity on borderline hypertension our study was conducted in an urban setting among faculty of the university of punjab lahore another study conducted among children in year showed that increasing rates of urbanization and associated behavioral changes have led to a higher prevalence of a sedentary lifestyle and less exercise it is estimated that children today spend kcal day less on physical activity than their counterparts years ago if only population exercise levels can be improved and sustained the cardiovascular risk burden will decrease effect of exercise shown in a meta analysis in year including studies with participants concluded that for hypertensive patients aerobic exercise with at least one minute session of moderate intensity per week was associated with a drop in systolic blood pressure of about mmhg and a drop in diastolic blood pressure of about mmhg in our study mean baseline systolic and diastolic blood pressures of the study and control groups were also measured after the three month intervention in the experimental group mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures of experimental and control groups were again recorded reduction in post intervention mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures was found to be statistically significant in experimental group ttest that is greater than mmhg at p less than whereas no such reduction in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures were seen in control group at the commencement and end of the stipulated period it is concluded that on the basis of the results of this study it is seen that physical activity can lower borderline hypertension reducing blood pressure can prevent the excess risk of cardiovascular diseases associated with borderline hypertension persuading patients to make lasting changes in their physical activity patterns is however challenging limitations of the study borderline hypertension is a highly prevalent condition it is therefore necessary that research must be carried out with large sample size so as to generalize the results to the wider community a three month period for physical activity is not predictive of change in lifestyle behavior the effect of intervention should have been evaluated after six months and one year intervals to measure long term outcomes

difference in terms of genders physical activity should be encouraged in both genders to avoid obesity related complications bmi should be measured routinely particularly in sedentary and physically inactive individuals key words bmi body mass index physical activity introduction obesity is a global problem and its prevalence has almost doubled since however different regions of the world are showing variation in the prevalence rates of obesity obesity is more prevalent in the pacific islands europe and north america variable prevalence in africa and middle east and least prevalent in asia world health organization who has developed who global infobase for collecting data on chronic diseases and their risk factors for all who member states one of its indicators is body mass index bmi in over billion adults were overweight and more than million men and about million women were obese according to who estimates obesity is present in of indian population more prevalent among females than males in pakistan one in four individuals is either overweight or obese page of association of low physical activity with high body mass index in both genders overweight and obesity are defined by using various anthropometric measurements like body mass index bmi waist circumference and waistto hip ratio who used bmi to classify overweight bmi greater than and obesity bmi greater than in adults the experts proposed a lower cutoff values of bmi for the definitions of overweight kg m and obesity greater than kg m in asian population however who expert consultation concluded that although selective high risk asians are at increased risk of developing type diabetes and cardiovascular diseases at bmi lower than who cut off value however the existing data is not suggestive of any cut off point of bmi for overweight or obesity in asian population hence who expert consultation recommended retaining the existing bmi cut off values for obesity and overweight classification raised bmi is an important risk factor for major cardiovascular diseases heart disease and stroke and diabetes bmi is a simple inexpensive and noninvasive tool that serves as surrogate measure of body fat as it measures excess weight rather than excess fat various factors like age sex ethnicity and muscle mass can alter the relationship between bmi and body fat studies have shown an association of low physical activity and body mass index low physical activity has been shown to increase atherosclerotic coronary heart disease and has been recognized as emerging risk factors this has been shown that physical activity reduces genetic predisposition to the obesity and also shown to reduce the mortality local data from pakistani studies is also suggestive of high prevalence of obesity and bmi with sedentary lifestyle however data on physical activity and bmi is lacking in azad kashmir we conducted this study to compare the association of low physical activity with high body mass index bmi in both genders at divisional headquarter hospital mirpur methodology this was an open label non randomized prospective study of one year duration from st jan to dec conducted at cardiology department

obese patients diabetes was present in cases hypertension in cases hyper cholesterolemia in cases and smoking in only cases table v discussion our study clearly showed that low level of physical activity is significantly associated with high body mass index which have cardiovascular mortality and morbidity implications low physical activity should be discouraged from childhood as metabolic syndrome is being increasingly recognized at pediatric age both parents and teachers and more community role will be required in this regards low physical activity is increasingly being seen as emerging risk factor for development of atherosclerotic coronary artery disease high mortality has been reported with both overweight and obese patients our study is first in the region of azad jammu and kashmir suggesting the magnitude of the problem a very large frequency of diabetes and hypertension was another important observation in our study according to american heart association guidelines body mass index is useful parameter to assess obesity with different techniques having both advantages and disadvantages physical activity in our study was classified into sedentary light moderate vigorous and high in our study lack of physical activity was significantly associated with high bmi this finding is favoring other international studies that physical inactivity is associated with obesity and raised bmi other studies from pakistan also showed a higher prevalence of physical inactivity in obese individuals in our study males were more over weight as compared to females however more females were were obese as compared to males however this difference was not significant studies have shown that obesity is relatively more common in females with race and income as stronger risk factors for obesity in females however the associations of obesity with gender age ethnicity and socioeconomic status are very complex and cannot be oversimplified our study showed that low physical activity can lead to obesity in both genders and there is no difference in terms of genders fighting obesity and metabolic syndrome needs to target it from childhood and adolescent levels and measure bmi even at school age to identify the persons and to make an effective strategy one such strategy was set by new york state department of health for prevention of overweight and obesity the goals were set to increase the awareness of overweight and obesity as a major public health threat and increase early recognition of overweight and or excessive weight gain apart from need to improve the management obesity and related diseases it was emphasized to improve the eating habits and increase the lifelong physical activity an important goal was set to decrease the exposure to television and other recreational screen time obesity is a major cause on non communicable diseases and is very common in pakistan unhealthy foods are one of the causes of increased obesity in our country as pakistani foods are energy dense the lack of physical activity and changing life styles are main contributing factors towards rapidly growing prevalence rates of obesity in pakistan who has developed a global strategy to promote and protect health by suggesting sustainable actions at individual community national and global levels to reduce disease and death rates related to unhealthy diet and physical inactivity unfortunately pakistan is lacking a national strategy to wrestle the obesity and we need to develop a national policy to promote physical activity in pakistan study limitations page of association of low physical activity with high body mass index in both genders we could not measure physical activity level using specially designed gauge accelerometer due to non availability of this gadget cost of gadget is very high and is available only in big cities conclusions low physical activity can lead to obesity in both genders and there is no difference in terms of genders physical activity should be encouraged in both genders to avoid obesity related complications bmi should be measured routinely particularly in sedentary and physically inactive individuals to

body functioning and human life in many ways untreated patient with hypertension has an average life expectancy between years compared with years for the population at large prevalence of hypertension among pakistani men is and among women is safdar omair faisal and hasan it is frequently prevalent in men after the age of years than women of that age and of the patients are unaware that they are suffering from hypertension research data support that women also suffer from high rate of hypertension steele and mcgarvey additionally there are an estimated million patients with hypertension in pakistan nishter shah luby rahbar khan and mccormick have reported that in rawalpindi division more than of the population over the age of years and over the age of years suffers from high blood pressure shah et al also reported that there are men with hypertension in karachi thus it may be concluded that hypertension is wide spread in different areas of pakistan is rapidly increasing scantily treated and controlled and is a great health hazard psychological condition of an individual greatly affects his physical condition anger is a normal emotion but if increases can cause devastating effects upon body and most conspicuously upon heart williams nieto sanford couper and tyroler it has been observed that occasionally healthy persons may also have conspicuous boost in their blood pressure if they are angery spielberger jacobs russell and crane borteyrou bruchon schweitzer and spielberger explain that anger is an arousing state which consists of feelings that vary in intensity from mild irritation to intense fury or rage it is reported that anger arousing situation also becomes a great reason of increase in blood pressure gerin et al page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension historically it roots back to when alexander identified the suppression of anger as a major cause of hypertension and further investigated its lethal outcomes upon human body reactivity hypothesis describes that individual prone to hypertension reacts to environmental stress with intense anger light in an earlier study on people with hypertension landesbergis schnoall warren pickering and schwartz explored that blood pressure rises remarkably during anger states association of anger with hypertension has been confirmed by many researchers player king mainous and geesey rutelage and hogan webb and beckstead which is a well established risk factor for coronary heart disease player et al borde perry campbell murtaugh gidding and falkner further append that there is an association between hypertension and cardiovascular diseases anger has many facets which affect the body equally but are different in nature and expression as described by spielberger state anger is explained as a psycho physiological condition comprising of subjective feelings that is different in emotion from mild resentment to intense anger and is related to the activation of autonomic nervous system trait anger is defined in terms of variation from person to person in the frequency of occurrence with which state anger is experienced over time so trait anger may rightly be called intense fury with greater frequency of occurrence next dimension of anger is anger in or anger suppression this is the attribute of a person how often he she experiences but held in or suppresses anger it refers to the frequency with which angry feelings of an individual are suppressed individual in front of an authority cannot express anger and has to hold in the angry feelings which have lethal affects upon body anger out is the frequency with which a person expresses angry feelings toward other people or objects in the environment in the forms of verbal or aggressive behavior anger control measures the frequency of attempting to control the expression of anger by an individual it is the tendency of an individual to prevent anger experience even passing through angry situation finally anger expression is an index of anger in anger out and anger control in which a person expresses and controls anger it reflects either the intensity of feeling or the frequency with which it is expressed sinclair czech joyner and munkasy according to schlomann and schmitke high blood pressure is the most common cause of hospital visits which means throwing away one s precious capital and time pakistan is a developing country where sources to earn livelihood are meager and prevalence of hypertension is safdar et al grimsrud et al examined that about hypertensive patients also experience one chronic disease co morbid with hypertension literature provides sufficient evidence that hypertension is a vital risk factor for many lethal diseases like heart problems renal disease loss of vision diabetes rheumatism etc kannel there is research evidence that hypertensive men and women are different in the expression of anger it is important to observe that gender differences in the expression of anger have been reported but these differences are related to the expression of anger and not with the frequency of anger expression spielberger krasner and solomon it is observed that men score high on anger out whereas women attain more scores on anger suppression and anger control which suggests that female role characteristics are related with anger suppression and male role characteristics are related with outwardly expressing anger kopper and epperson it is reported that anger expression is strongly related to increase in blood pressure reactivity in men whereas controlling anger is related to higher blood pressure reactivity in women shapiro jamner and goldstein in another investigation on gender related differences in cardiovascular reactivity and the role of anger inhibition as a risk of future hypertension it was concluded that there is more cardiovascular reactivity in men than in women during the state of anger vogele jarvis and cheeseman within the male group a combination of hypertension risk and anger in led to the highest reactivity whereas in female participants anger in had no effect on reactivity high anger level among hypertensive women have been reported by steele and mcgarvey the researchers also report that women less than or equal to years of age have a high tendency of anger expression and the children of parents with hypertension who were suffering from high rate on two measures of blood pressure they also had high scores on trait anger anger out and submissiveness page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension thus it may be concluded that anger is equally prevalent not only in men but also in women and children of parents with hypertension in a recent study anger in was found to be more prevalent in men than in women doster purdum martin goven and moorefield burgeoning literature on the subject reports that control of hypertension disease in pakistan has partial success jafar chaturvedi and pappas inadequate data is on hands regarding anger as a risk factor of hypertension within the indigenous population information obtained from some researches carried out on indigenous population is restricted to stress anxiety depression and hostility as risk factors of hypertension mushtaq and najam or biological factors only vaillant and gerber additionally it is a matter of concern for researchers that established risk factors in many cases do not completely determine hypertension notwithstanding the reality that hypertension was diagnosed many years earlier in south asia no study was conducted to identify the risk factors associated with hypertension in pakistan studies have hardly thrown light on the early onset of hypertension furthermore the awareness of threatening factors of hypertension has been greatly derived from data provided by developed countries nevertheless the expression or suppression of anger may vary from country to country due to cultural factors investigators are doubtful about the findings obtained from european societies and their application in rest of the world is questionable in pakistan especially this phenomenon has rarely been studied and researches conducted in this area are based upon the data drawn from lower masses only jafar et al regardless of its significance psychological aspects of hypertension have been ignored by researchers hereditary and biological factors of hypertension have always been over emphasized by physicians and medical specialists but the role of anger as a psychological risk factor have been ignored in pakistan therefore the current research would be the first and unique one to investigate the relationship between components of anger and hypertension among pakistani men and women belonging to middle class studying the prevalence of anger among hypertensive men and women and its predictive role in hypertension are the main objectives of present research previous research data related to the subject provides the evidence of researches using only correlational design by employing participants with hypertensive only however case control research design was employed in the present research to compare both groups on all dimensions of anger which is considered a standardized method for studies sparrenberger et al the following hypotheses were formulated keeping in view the objectives of the study hypotheses there is positive relationship between components of anger and hypertension key components of anger are the positive predictors of hypertension men with hypertension experience more anger on all components of anger than women with hypertension method participants the data n were collected outdoor departments of public hospitals from the two major public hospitals by using purposive sampling technique inclusion criteria for hypertensive patients was a participants who had the confirmed diagnosis of hypertension b who had been currently taking medicines for hypertension c who were able to read and write urdu language and d patients who were not suffering from any terminal illness or chronic disease including renal disease cancer coronary heart disease liver disease and history of any psychiatric diagnosis or psychiatric medication and pregnant women with high blood pressure complaints non hypertensive group was matched to every case of hypertension for age up to years older and younger gender monthly income and working hours non hypertensive group was taken from the hospitals a they were not the siblings children or parents of the cases diagnosed with hypertension b they were not diagnosed with page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension hypertension and c with no past or current family history of hypertension were included in the non hypertensive group sample characteristics of hypertensive patients age range of hypertensive patients was from to years m sd their monthly income was ranged from rs to m sd their monthly expenditures ranged from rs to m sd the weight of the hypertensive patients ranged from to kg m sd and their height ranged from to feet m sd the working hours of the respondents were ranged from to hours m sd sample characteristics of non hypertensive control group the age range of cases controls non hypertensive group was from to years m sd the monthly

expenditures height and weight family history of hypertension spouse job family system hospital visits and working hours of the research participants state trait anger expression inventory it was originally developed by spielberger consisting of items the respondents can obtain scores from to higher scores show higher level of anger in all cases the items are divided into six subscales and overall anger which are state anger trait anger anger in anger out anger control and anger expression state anger and trait anger subscales contain items each anger in anger out and anger control contain items each anger expression is an overall index of anger in anger out and anger control each item has four response categories representing point likert scale ranging from never to very often spielberger reported that state trait anger expression inventory staxi has high internal consistency with cronbach s a urdu version was prepared by the researcher and used in the present research mushtaq page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension procedure permission was obtained from administration of two public hospitals for data collection and from author of the scale consent from the participants suffering from hypertension and healthy controls was sought to participate in present study initially rapport was established by assuring them about the discretion of their personal information and that it would be used for research purpose only before administration of urdu version of staxi participants were briefed about the nature and purpose of the study a demographic information form and staxi were individually administered to all research participants total individuals were approached and gave their consent to take part in the research participants were not given monetary compensation for their participation they were only verbally told the likely benefits the research would impart to the society and may be the future generations could be saved from becoming hypertensive many patients who initially refused to participate in the research after this brief description got ready to take part many participants were eager to know their scores on components of anger which was provided to them by making individual telephone calls the sample was drawn from outdoors of hospitals results descriptive statistics was used to calculate the preliminary profile of the sample characteristics mentel haenzel test of linear association mhtla was run to explore the relationship between components of anger and hypertension binary logistic regression models were used to identify subscales of anger as predictors of hypertension independent sample t test was employed to examine differences on anger subscales between hypertensive men and women relationship between anger and hypertension mhtla was applied for exploring the relationship between different measures of staxi and hypertension if the exposure variable is ordinal the ordinary chi square test does not take into account the inherent order among the categories it hardly checks the overall departure of observed from expected across the cells of the table a test of linear association pearson chi square between columns and rows will be statistically insufficient because it fails to distinguish between one and two category differences hanif ahmed and ahmed mhtla is considered statistically more powerful test which gives smaller p value if the relationship is significant as compared to chi square test in case of categorical outcome variable it has been observed that mhtla provides better results than chi square test of association table relationship between subscales of anger and hypertension n variables no of items m sd mh state anger trait anger anger in anger out anger control anger expression total anger the chi square values of mantle haenzel linear association given in table indicate that state anger trait anger anger in anger control and total anger are significantly positively correlated with hypertension whereas anger out is negatively correlated with hypertension but relationship is statistically non significant predictors of hypertension a logistic regression analysis was carried out to find the subscales of anger as predictors of hypertension which included state anger trait anger anger in anger control and anger hypertension was taken as dependent variable and dichotomized into two groups based upon their being hypertensive or not hypertensive and were coded as non hypertensive and hypertensive anger and its subscales were taken as independent and ordinal variables page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension table logistic regression analysis to examine components of anger as risk factors predictors of hypertension n variable b s e wald p ci ll ul constant state anger trait anger anger in anger control anger the prediction value of r in table shows that model is adequately fit and anger and its subscales are contributing in the hypertension disease the odds ratio for state anger is and coefficient is positive therefore as the state anger increases by one scale unit chances of hypertension in a person increased times the odds ratio for trait anger is and coefficient is positive so each unit increase in the scores of trait anger is associated with the odds of hypertension increase by a factor of the odds ratio for anger in is and coefficient is positive consequently as the anger in increases by one scale unit chances of hypertension in a person is increased times the odds ratio for anger control is and coefficient in positive so each unit increase in the scores of anger control is associated with the odds of hypertension increase by a factor of the odds ratio for anger is and the coefficient is positive therefore as the anger increases by one scale unit chances of hypertension in an individual is increased times thus state anger trait anger anger in anger control and anger are significantly predicting hypertension progression gender differences on anger to measure gender differences in anger among hypertensive group independent sample t test was computed table mean scores

table gender differences in mean scores for state anger trait anger anger in anger out anger expression and anger are statistically significant men express more state anger anger in anger out anger expression and anger as compared to women women exhibit higher levels of trait anger and anger control than men the values of cohen s d indicate that anger in and anger have larger affect on hypertensive men as compared to hypertensive women whereas anger control has greater affect on hypertensive women than hypertensive men discussion the present study has sought the relationship of anger with hypertension the results indicate the relationship of hypertension with state anger trait anger anger in anger control and anger is statistically significant further present research showed that state anger is significantly correlated and predicts hypertension gupta joshi mohan reddy and yusuf elaborate the factors which lead angry individual towards developing hypertension those factors are irrational perceptions of reality and four types of thinking styles which are emotional reasoning emotional misinterpreting normal events and tend to become irritated low frustration tolerance unreasonable expectations and evaluations of other people the external factors of anger include verbal abuses attack one s ideas threat to one s needs and frustrations other causes of anger are frustration disappointment and feelings of page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension powerlessness unfulfilled expectations annoyance harassment and rejection thus it can be concluded that low frustration tolerance and external factors leads them immediately to enrage or become furious in present situation experiencing state anger this finding is corroborated with other researches conducted in europe which conclude that hypertensive patients experience more state anger than normal individuals everson goldberg kaplan julkunen and salonen porter stone and schwartz it is also observed that individuals with state anger experience intense anger which may be expressed as a wish to yell at others or to break things according to spielberger during this state of anger there is moderate to severe activation in the sympathetic nervous system of the individuals we may conclude that due to this activation of autonomous nervous system they immediately get enraged these individuals are impulsive in reaction to anger provoking situations the finding further supported the hypothesis that trait anger is statistically significant in hypertensive patients and predicts hypertension trait anger is defined in terms of variation from person to person in the frequency of occurrence that state anger is experienced occasionally trait anger can rightly be called intense fury with greater frequency of occurrence and the individuals with this trait might easily become victims of hypertension spielberger this result coincides with previous researches which have stated that trait anger in adults was associated with increased risk of developing hypertension by and large trait anger assesses an individual s general personality predisposition to become furious easily it is manifested among individuals who have overall confrontational or argumentative personality makeup according to spielberger if individual thinks that he she is mistreated by others or criticized by others he she is experiencing trait anger hypertension predicted by trait anger is also reported by earlier finding williams et al furthermore the results reveal that anger in or anger suppression is statistically significant in hypertensive patients and anger in also predicts hypertension if the individual holds in or suppress anger when passing through resentful situation it is called anger in hypertensive patients cannot express their anger related impulses in a healthy way rather they try to suppress these impulses there is sufficient empirical evidence which suggest that anger suppression is significantly related with hypertension cottington matthews talbott and kuller ghosh and sharma pickering schneider egan johnson dronby and julius vogele et al webb and beckstead moreover strong association of anger suppression with hypertension has been found by previous researches alexander pickering rutelage and hogan there is widespread uniformity in the results drawn by researches all over the world that psychological anger is responsible for developing hypertension everson et al player et al the findings from an earlier study argued that the hypertension is an emotional disease and many psychological variables especially anger control is a major factor in developing hypertension rosen and gregory this explanation is in accordance with state and trait theory presented by spielberger which states that hypertensive individuals possess trait anger and wants to express it however due to some reasons they could not express their anger and are forced to control it this suppressing of anger or anger control leads reactivity in their nervous system which ultimately causes different diseases one of them is hypertension earlier in alexander explains that controlling anger would result in increase in blood pressure and cause hypertension to develop the current results further suggest statistically significant differences on different components of state anger trait anger anger in anger out anger control anger expression and anger as reported by hypertensive men and women it has been noticed that the hypertensive men reported more anger than hypertensive women in the current research project this research finding is corroborative with the matthews et al that delineated the incidence of significantly more anger in men therefore the difference on psychological anger between men and women was statistically significant it is worldwide established that anger is a strong risk factor of hypertension in men than in women chida and steptoe in a research anger in was significantly found in men as compared to women harburg julius kaciroti gleiberman and schork trait anger was found to be more prevalent among women in the present research page of anger as a psychological risk factor of hypertension it is also globally established that women express more trait anger as compared to men raikkonen matthews flory and owens furthermore men in the present research obtained high scores on state anger and anger out that corroborates with previous researches spielberger et al in fact a close relationship exists between trait anger and anger trait anger and anger control are found more significantly associated with women as compared to men coincides with early findings spielberger reheiser and sydeman limitations and suggestions the main limitation of the current research was that the present study was carried out with a small sample which may not be considered exact representative of entire hypertensive population it may be a threat to the external validity of this research another main limitation was that bmi was not calculated in the present research bmi could have given more comprehensive results regarding the role of physical conditions in developing hypertension another limitation of the current research was the use of self report scales which might have resulted in under reporting or over reporting due to the nature of the disease they were suffering from therefore it is recommended that in future researches focus group and interview techniques must also be conducted in addition to self report questionnaires to gather more wide ranging information about the degree and nature of anger assessment among men and women hypertensive patients moderating role of gender in the relationship between anger and hypertension is also strongly recommended to examine in future researches implications the investigation regarding role of anger in developing hypertension is an important area of the present research the early identification of anger and its suppression in developing hypertension in america has yielded some promising results in treating it the results can be highlighted through media and public health awareness programs understanding the psychological causes of hypertension could open up lines of scientific inquiry and to investigate the heterogeneity of outcome when measured across multiple dimensions of anger the findings of this research have implications for promoting our understanding regarding role of anger as a major predictor of hypertension

saleem atif abbasi syed masroor anwar kamran abbas and hira ghulam nabi body abstract hypertension is considered to be significant threat for the mankind in the developing countries as well as in developed countries the purpose of this study was to check the association among different physical risk factors of heart disease and hypertension and to find the main causes of hypertension in the patients of district muzaffarabad a sample of hypertensive patients was analyzed a close ended structured questionnaire was used to collect the information from the respondents the questionnaires were distributed randomly to well trained staff nurses who collected the information from the respondents the pearson chi square test and phi values were used to see the association of hypertension with different risk factors logistic regression model was performed to get the most significant risk factors of hypertension there were found that the existence of hypertension in the patients was due to eight major risk factors age monthly income number of children patient s sugar level cholesterol level smoking marital status the result showed that the only variable family history was not associated with hypertension the data was analyzed using spss version key words logistic regression odds ratios hypertension introduction hypertension is the force of blood pushing against the inside walls of arteries blood pressure is the force of blood pushing up against the blood vessel walls the higher the pressure the harder the heart has to pump according to medilexicon s medical dictionary hypertension means high blood pressure transitory or sustained elevation of systemic arterial blood pressure to a level likely to induce cardiovascular damage or other adverse consequences hypertension may be classified as essential or secondary essential hypertension is the high blood pressure with unknown cause genetic factors may involve in it whereas secondary hypertension is the term for high blood pressure with a known direct cause such as endocrine disorders oral contraceptives diabetes or kidney disease it is sometimes called the silent killer because a person could have it for years without even knowing it it can be a very dangerous illness if not treated properly in right time in a right way with proper diet exercise or medication hypertension is a easily manageable disease according to the report of the seventh joint national committee on hypertension it is now a major public health problem affecting million individuals in the united states and and billion individuals worldwide and the prevalence of ht will increase even more unless broad and effective preventive measures are implemented epidemiological studies conducted over the past decades have shown consistent continuous and independent relations of ht to cardiovascular disease cvd numerous cross sectional and cohort studies have provided important and valuable information on ht prevalence and page of most significant risk factors of hypertension a case study in muzaffarabad azad kashmir incidence and their correlation for white black and other ethnic populations with fewer studies conducted in american indians even borderline hypertension pre hypertension may cause significant rise in stroke and cardiovascular deaths in a study comparisons of risks of ht among subgroups in each characterized group after adjusting for center age and sex pre hypertensive american and indians had times higher risk of developing ht than normotensive subjects similar assessments for bmi subgroups and other risk factors showed different risks as follows obese versus normal times overweight versus normal weight diabetic status dm versus nfg dm versus ifg albuminuria macroalbuminuria versus normal microalbuminuria versus normal and tgs greater than mmol l versus mmol l greater than mg dl versus mg dl insulin resistance homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance insulin fpg as measured by the homeostasis model assessment also showed a significant increasing risk of ht of and times with each increasing quartile those with a history of current alcohol consumption a parental history of ht a parental history of dm or with higher insulin concentration had higher risk of ht than those without these factors systemic blood pressure rises with age and the incidence of cardiovascular disease particularly stroke and coronary artery disease is closely related to average blood pressure at all ages the cardiovascular risks associated with a given blood pressure are depended upon the combination of risk factors in the specific individual these include age family history weight physical inactivity gender smoking cholesterol diabetes and pre existing vascular disease the risk factors such as hypertension and diabetes in the south african population were the most important determinants of mortality therefore the present study was conducted to highlight the most significant risk factors of hypertension through bivariate and multivariate statistical analysis of the data this study may also raised the awareness among people of azad jammu and kashmir muzaffarabad about risk factors and gravity of hypertension material and methods a cross sectional descriptive as well as inferential study was conducted a sample of hypertensive patients was collected on from the time period july to september from abbas institute of medical sciences aims and combined military hospital muzaffarabad cmh a close ended structured questionnaire was used to collect the information from the respondents the questionnaires were distributed randomly to well trained staff nurses who collected the information from the respondents the data recorded for the variables age of the patient monthly income number of children sugar level cholesterol level smoking marital status and family history bivariate analysis of categorical variables was done by the pearson chi square test the phi values were calculated to determine the type of association i e positive or negative association through logistic regression analysis odds ratios and ci was also calculated for categorical variables the hypertension is taken as dichotomous dependent variable the wald s test statistic was used to test the significance of the individual coefficient of each risk factor all statistical analysis was performed by using spss results table basic information about hypertension classification of blood pressure measurements according to jnc category systolic blood diastolic blood pressure pressure optimal less than less than normal less than less than page of most significant risk factors of hypertension a case study in muzaffarabad azad kashmir pre

greater than years total monthly income greater than total number of children more than total sugar level greater than mmol l less than mmol l cholesterol level greater than mmol l less than mmol l total smoking not smoking smoking total marital status unmarried married total family history no yes total the results showed that from table the variables age monthly income number of children sugar level cholesterol smoking and marital status were statistically significant and have positive association with the presence of hypertension and the individual effect of eight risk factors have significant contribution and only family history was nonsignificant it shows that as the above variable quantity increases the risk of hypertension increases from table the result of wald test shows that all the variables mentioned above have significant contribution in the development of hypertension because each have a p value less than the level of significance the first factor is age we coded age into three categories years years and greater than years the coefficient of age has positive value with degree of freedom and it shows positive relation of age and hypertension it is observed that the patients in the age group years were times more likely to have hypertension than the patients whose age group was years similarly the patients whose age group was greater than years are times more likely to have hypertension disease than the patients whose age group was page of most significant risk factors of hypertension a case study in muzaffarabad azad kashmir years and the confidence interval for the odds ratios of the age group years and greater than years is also calculated and the limits for the age group years are to and its p value is and the limits for the age group greater than years are to and its p value is and the values of wald s test for the age group and greater than years are also calculated which are and respectively their p values are less than level of significance it also shows significant results the second factor is income we coded income into three categories and greater than the coefficient of income has value with d f and it shows positive relation of income and hypertension it is also observed that the patients whose monthly income was are times more chance to have hypertension than the patients whose monthly income was greater than similarly the patients whose monthly income was are times more likely to have hypertension than the patients whose monthly income was greater than and the ci for the odds ratios of income and is to and to respectively and the value of wald s test for the patients whose income was is and the patients whose income was is and their p values are and which are less than level of significance and it also shows significant results the third factor is number of children the categories for number of children are and more than the children and hypertension it is found that the patients having number of children are times more likely to have hypertension than the patients having number of children similarly the patients having more than children are times more likely to have hypertension than the patients having children the ci for the odds ratios for and more than children is to and to respectively and the value of wald s test for the patients whose children are is and the patients whose children are more than is and their p values are and which are less than level of significance and and this situation also shows significant results the fourth factor is sugar level the categories of sugar level are greater than mmol l and less than mmol l the coefficient of sugar is and is positive with d f and it shows positive relation of sugar level and hypertension it is noticed that the patients whose sugar level was greater than mmol l has times more chances to have hypertension than the patients whose sugar level was less than mmol and the ci for the odds ratios for high sugar level is to and the value of wald s test is also calculated which is and its p value is very small which is less than level of significance and and this scenario shows significant result wald s test is also calculated for married patients which is and its p value is very small and less than level of coefficient of number of children has positive value with d f and it shows positive relation of number of significance and and it shows significant result the eighth factor is family history the coefficient of family history is with d f and it shows positive relation of family history and hypertension it is also noticed that the patients who had a patient of hypertension in their family has times more chances of hypertension disease as compared to the patients who had no family page of most significant risk factors of hypertension a case study in muzaffarabad azad kashmir history of hypertension and the ci for the patients who has family history of hypertension is to and the value of wald s test is also calculated which is and its p value is which is less than level of significance and and it also shows significant result the final fitted logistic model is as under equation where z age income children sugar cholesterol smoking marital status history discussion the main aim of this study was to evaluate and dig out the physical key risk factors of hypertension in cases were years of age were years of age and were greater than years of age the phi value for age is which shows positive association it means that years of age has more chances of hypertension than the years and greater than years in developed countries it is considered that only of deaths occur below the age of years however in south asia of cvd deaths occur among people under years out of cases had income had income and had income greater than the phi value for monthly income is which show positive association it means that the low income increases the rates of hypertension patients than the high income low and middle income countries bear a large burden of cardiovascular disease cvd accounting for of the global cvd related deaths and of disability adjusted life years lost cvd rapidly has become a major cause of mortality and morbidity in low income south asian countries as well the cases had number of children more than cases had number of children and had number of children the phi value for association it means that as the number of children increases the rates of hypertension patient increases in these cases had sugar level greater than mmol l and had sugar level less than mmol l the phi value for sugar is which show positive association the value of odds ratio shows that there are times more chances to be a hypertension patient with sugar level greater than mmol l than the sugar level less than mmol l a significant proportion of the hypertensive patients were having uncontrolled hypertension nearly th of the population was suffering from rht which was significantly associated with the presence of obesity and diabetes mellitus therapeutic inertia seems to contribute significantly towards the presence of uncontrolled bp out of cases had cholesterol level greater than mmol l and had cholesterol level less than mmol l the phi value for cholesterol level is which show positive association the coefficient shows that the effect of high cholesterol is positive that is the cholesterol level greater than mmol increases the chance of hypertension in a study conducted on hypertension in women were classified according to the international diabetes federation s worldwide definition of the metabolic syndrome which includes a wc cm plus of the followings raised triglycerides mmol l reduced hdl cholesterol less than mmol l raised blood pressure systolic bp or diastolic bp mm hg and raised fasting plasma glucose mmol l page of most significant risk factors of hypertension a case study in muzaffarabad azad kashmir in these cases were nonsmokers and were smokers the phi value for smoking is which show positive association the odds ratio for smoking is which shows that the chance of incidence of hypertension in smokers is times more than in nonsmokers in these cases were married and only were unmarried out of cases the phi value for marital status is which show positive association the p value for marital status is which shows positive association the coefficient of marital status is also positive i e and the odds ratio is therefore by married risk factor of hypertension increases by times in these cases had no family history of hypertension and had family history of hypertension the phi value for family history is which show positive association the odds ratio for the patients who had family history of hypertension is which shows the chance of hypertension is times more in the patients with the family history of hypertension as compared to the patients with no family history of hypertension conclusion the results suggested that the occurrence of hypertension is strongly related to the variables such as age monthly income number of children sugar level cholesterol level smoking marital status and only the family history shows the no association with hypertension different cardiovascular risk factors including blood pressure tend to be strongly associated with each other identification of these risk factors at an early stage of life is an important opportunity for primary prevention of hypertension through lifestyle modification to prevent disease progression health education of the public is needed to control the various risk factors of hypertension life style measures should be initiated especially in those with raised total cardiovascular risk as well as communities as a whole the measures include weight

at karachi journal of postgraduate medical institute june monday copyright postgraduate medical institute all rights reserved section vol no length words byline sikandar hayat khan and syed azhar ahmad body abstract objective to compare platelet indices among patients with low and high levels of cholesterolemia and triglyceridemia methodology this cross sectional study was conducted from january to may at the departments of pathology pns rahat and baqai medical and dental university karachi a total of subjects presenting for estimation of fasting triglycerides and total cholesterol were selected after excluding patients receiving anti platelet or lipid medication pregnancy acute infectious disorders they were interviewed examined and sampled for measurement of total cholesterol triglycerides and platelet indices including total platelet count mean platelet volume mpv platelet distribution width pdw and platecrit pct results the results of platelet count and mean platelet volume were found to be significantly different among subjects with normal cholesterolemia less than mmol l borderline raised cholesterol group mmol l and hypercholesterolemia greater than mmol l however post hoc comparison did not show any significant difference between all groups using age as a variable and segregating total cholesterol results into groups starting from very low cholesterol values less than mmol l to highest greater than mmol l in a univariate general linear model higher mean platelet volume were observed at the extremes of cholesterolemia groups p a similar trend was observed for platelet count after adjusting for age where low levels of platelet levels were associated with hypocholesterolemia and hypercholesterolemia p conclusion higher mpv and low total platelet counts were associated with the observed extremes of cholesterol range no significant differences were observed for platelet indices across various groups formulated based upon fasting triglycerides key words platelet count platecrit pct mean platelet volume mpv platelet distribution width pdw total cholesterol triglycerides introduction the role of platelets in health and disease cannot be underestimated physiologically the platelets are primed to induce the formation of primary homeostatic plug and later to ensure coagulation by repairing the endothelial vessel repair the pathological dimensions about the platelet s role are simply an extension of their physiological function in health and include exaggerated atherogenesis and thrombus formation the available evidence highlights that certain morphological changes do appear before these platelets get consumed in the accelerated process of atherosclerosis including coronary artery disease stroke and others these morphological changes in the platelets and possibly their numerical counts may indicate the possible platelet activation in such situations so changes could be possible in both platelet numbers and morphological appearance once they encounter an page of relationship between platelet indices and lipidemias a cross sectional study at karachi atherogenic environment in the plasma alongside the current risk stratification strategies rely heavily upon the measurement of lipids in blood raised levels of cholesterol or triglycerides may indicate an underlying possibility of enhanced fat deposition in vasculature with risk for cardiovascular disease thus varied or enhanced platelet lipid interactions should possibly lead to accelerations in atherosclerosis with ultimate outcome in the shape of cardiovascular diseases present day management approaches in medicine are the emergence of various anti platelet and anti lipids medications for both primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular diseases considering the role of platelet and lipid interactions in the formation and then rupture of atherosclerotic plaque as fundamental following aspects prompt us to evaluate the role of available platelet indices with lipidemia firstly platelet indices including numerical counts mean platelet volumes mpv platelet distribution width pdw and platecrit pct are now routinely measured on commonly used hematological cell counters in most developing countries an establish link between lipids and platelet indices can provide commonality of targets for both in vogue therapeutic use and also the diagnostic side can be better used for monitoring patients secondly literature review albeit sparse does highlight studies not linking cardiovascular disease progression with morphological platelet changes kalay et al during their evaluation of progression of coronary artery disease did not find changes in mean platelet volumes as different while showed at that the same time factors like cholesterol being significant between progressive and non progressive groups thirdly most studies evaluating the link between platelet indices and cholesterol have confined their roles to platelet counts and mean platelet volume while less data is available to demonstrate the relationship between platelet parameters and triglycerides finally multiple studies have identified the ethnicity and racial aspects to be a very important determinant in the development of cardiovascular diseases especially in asians while studies have identified multiple reasons to this ethnic predisposition still other factors remain there to be explored further exploration into platelet to lipid interaction could be one area which may further identify the association between our ethnicity to peaking prevalence of cardiovascular diseases keeping this background in mind the study was planned to evaluate the platelet indices as generated on a common hematological analyzers with those patient s cholesterol levels for possible association methodology this was a cross sectional study planned at the departments of pathology pns rahat in liaison with baqai medical and dental college karachi between january to may based upon non probability convenience sampling all subjects who presented in medical fasting status i e overnight fast of hours after excluding the state of stress like acute ailment or apparent anxiety for analysis of their lipid status were considered for inclusion into the study the several exclusions were pregnancy having an acute infectious disorder admitted patients on anti platelet or other cholesterol lowering medications not observing an exact medical fasting status or collected sample being rendered unfit due to marked hemolysis or other reasons a total of subjects were finally selected for study after explanation of study purpose and signing of the consent performa enrolled individuals were interviewed clinically examined and then sent to the phlebotomy station for collection of ml of blood as per standard procedure ml of blood collected in heparinized vacutainer tubes was sent to chemical pathology workstation for analysis of total cholesterol and serum triglycerides ml of blood collected in edta bottle was sent to hematology workstation for analysis of platelet indices including platelet counts mean platelet volume mpv platelet distribution width pdw and platecrit pct total cholesterol was analyzed by chod pap methodology and triglycerides were measured by gpo pap technique on clinical chemistry analyzer hitachi platelet indices were measured on automated hematology analyzer grouping of results triglyceridemia status the results were grouped as group serum triglyceride results less than mmol l group serum triglyceride results between to mmol l group serum triglyceride resultsgreater than mmol l page of relationship between platelet indices and lipidemias a cross sectional study at karachi total cholesterol groups were made as group serum total cholesterol less than mmol l group serum total cholesterol between mmol l group serum total cholesterol results greater than mmol l later we further segregated the subject s cholesterol and triglyceride results into seven groups in order to understand the differences between the groups as highlighted by post hoc comparisons data analysis was done by using spss version first mean and sd confidence intervals were calculated for age frequencies were calculated for gender the results of total cholesterol and triglycerides were compared between various age groups by one way anova correlation between total cholesterol and triglycerides with platelet indices and age were calculated by pearson s correlation the differences for platelet counts and other platelet parameters among various groups formulated based upon their total cholesterol and triglycerides were measured by one way anova along with post hoc comparisons later univariate general linear model glm was utilized keeping the effect of age as a co variate to measure the effect of platelet counts and mean platelet volumes among total cholesterol groups which were further segregated into groups to understand which groups had the most differences as highlighted by post hoc analysis results the mean age among our data set was years were male while were female the results of total cholesterol and fasting triglycerides remained significantly different among various age groups table overall correlations between platelet indices with total cholesterol and triglycerides are shown in table the results of platelet count and mean platelet volume were found to be significantly different among cholesterolemia group table however posthoc comparison did not show these results to be significantly different between all the groups adjusting age and with further segregation of total cholesterol levels into seven groups in a univariate general linear model showed higher mean platelet volume at both extremes of cholesterol i e hypocholesterolemia less than mmol l and hypercholesterolemia greater than mmol l figure a similar trend was observed for platelet count after adjusting age where low levels of platelet levels were linked p with hypocholesterolemia and hypercholesterolemia figure cholesterol levels between mmol l to mmol l were not found with lower platelet levels table showed a no association between platelet indices and serum fasting triglycerides discussion our study is the pioneer local study which has attempted to demonstrate the relationship between various platelet indices with cholesterol and triglycerides the relationship between cholesterol remained only significant for mean platelet volume and platelet counts however a deeper dissection of our data

variability in this regard santimone et al have shown a significant relationship between both raised cholesterol and triglycerides levels with platelet levels mpv readings were not found to be significantly raised with hypercholesterolemia in the same study moreover the authors did acknowledge that the results only explained minimally the variability which surrounds the platelet results our findings depicted both hypocholestrolemia and hypercholesterolemia as associated with lower platelet levels and higher mpv the probable explanations for our findings are suggested as apart from hypercholesterolemia we did find raised mpv and low platelets with hypocholesterolemia hypercholesterolemia in literature is well known identified direct risk factor for cardiovascular disease however there is available evidence which also points out towards the role of hypocholestrolemia as important entity which results in subject s predisposition towards a higher adverse outcome another study by reuben et al have highlighted that lower cholesterol results are associated with inflammation that could lead to higher patient mortality similarly a regional study by okamura et al have also identified a cholesterol level of less than mmol l to be associated with higher all cause mortality thirdly the possibility that the u curve for mpv and inverted v in case of platelets in our graphs as observed could be a random finding as post hoc comparisons in actual did provide statistical significance between few groups only however keeping in page of relationship between platelet indices and lipidemias a cross sectional study at karachi view the sample size methodology and the aforementioned evidence we consider our results to be significant and makes us feel that more controlled trials in general population may be done to augment or disapprove our findings finally the clinically available platelet parameters may not be predictive of underlying cardiovascular disease risk as beyan et al did not find any correlations between the anatomic platelet indices like platelet mpv and others with functional platelet markers for activation suggesting that such markers cannot depict underlying platelet activation similarly another italian study attempting to demonstrate a relationship between platelet parameters mpv and platelet counts and thrombotic events did not prove a stronger link between the two while showing a significant relationship with cholesterol at the same time the relationship between fasting triglycerides and platelet parameters was not found to be significant in our study apart from the study by santimore et al not much data is available to negate or augment our conclusions moreover a lot of evidence is there which only demonstrate triglycerides as dependent risk factors for cardiovascular diseases or identified it as a metabolic cluster with associated findings of insulin resistance thus the likely conclusion at our end is that triglyceride don not affect platelet indices limitations our study may have limitations some due to its inherent design as a cross sectional one and being a study carried out in clinical settings an epidemiological study incorporating subjects from different sections of life may provide a better tool to further evaluate the lipid platelet relationship secondly the subject of lipidology is further evolving which may yield further insight into the aforementioned relationship however in a clinical set up our utilized markers are the ones which on account of their feasible measurements and cost may become a better investigative tool after more clinical research however the study may be important clinically as it has provide a direct insight into the lipid platelet link which has been attributed as common end pint in the development of atherosclerotic plaque the data our study provides the shifting dynamics between established cardiovascular predispositions like cholesterol levels with candidate markers of accelerated atherosclerosis i e platelet indices future may allow better refining of platelet parameters through further research and technology improvement and for their routine clinical use conclusion platelet parameters differ including their number and volumes i e higher mpv and low platelet counts in subjects with hypercholesterolemia greater than mmol l and hypocholestrolemia less than mmol l no significant differences were observed for platelet indices across various groups formulated based upon individual s fasting triglyceridemia status references

and maintaining weight is strongly recommended in younger population so as to promote public health article introduction obesity is one of the most common disorders seen in medical practice which is very frustrating and difficult to manage and assessed by excess of adipose tissue accurate quantification of body fat requires sophisticated techniques not usually available in clinical practice more quantitative evaluation to detect excess body fat is preformed by calculating the body mass index bmi by dividing measured body weight in kilograms by the height in meter squares i e kg m page of obesity overweight among healthy adult males seeking employment in pakistan army in the developing world prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased dramatically in recent years in pakistan obesity is one of the major nutritional problems it peaks increases with advancing age at years for both men and women in urban and rural settings and then decreases after years the national health survey of pakistan nhs revealed that of the population in pakistan was reported to be obese and overweight in the years age group studies from pakistan have given figures of people having overweight and obesity it is to be emphasized that in south asia including pakistan social and environmental changes are occurring rapidly with increasing urbanization changing lifestyles higher energy density of diets and reduced physical activity obese individuals differ not only in the amount of excess fat but also in the regional distribution of fat within the body and both general and abdominal adiposity are associated with the risk of death similarly obesity has numerous social consequences in later life such as lower wages less likelihood of marriage and less education world health organization has recommended different bmi cut off points for south east asia because they have more morbidity for any given bmi indo asian specific definition of obesity is set as bmi kg m and overweight as bmi kg m in pakistan the obesity pattern is currently in a transition from acute to an increase burden of chronic disease so present study was conducted to find out the frequency of overweight and obesity in healthy adults by measuring their bmi kg m in our setup material and methods a descriptive study was carried out at medical inspection room engineer centre risalpur and department of pathology combined military hospital risalpur from st march to th september five hundred males were enrolled in the study by non probability convenience sampling between years who were physically fit and had height within their th confidence interval a questionnaire was given to each candidate asking whether he knew that overweight is related to diseases and how can weight be lost whether by dieting exercise by both or he didn t know in order to compute bmi the height and weight of each individual was measured after completion of the questionnaire for this purpose standardized weighing scales and measuring tapes were used the formulae utilized during the data collection process are as follows bmi weight kg height m the cutoff criteria used for the bmi bmi less than kg m

increasingly vulnerable to the worldwide epidemic of obesity which affects all segments of the population in return obesity overweight is a significant risk factor for arteriosclerosis ischemic heart disease and diabetes all of which are major causes of morbidity and mortality present study has shown that participants were overweight and were obese which is in accordance with nhs and al tawarah ym et al who has shown that nearly participants were overweight or obese in jordan whereas asif sa et al have reported the higher prevalence of obesity in males in our set up as and overweight as similarly the metroville study in karachi reported that of men in the lower socio economic group were obese overweight and jafar et al has noted that out of pakistani over the age of years is overweight or obese international association for the study of obesity and the international obesity task force have suggested lower bmi cutoff values to define overweight kg m and obesity kg m or greater in asian populations we have used a bmi cutoff values kg m to define overweight in accordance with the study of jafar et al who had concluded that for identification of those at risk of hypertension and diabetes and healthy page of obesity overweight among healthy adult males seeking employment in pakistan army targets may require the use of even lower bmi cutoff values less than kg m than those already proposed for an indo asian population similarly nanan d compared the prevalence of overweight for adults aged to years in the united states us and pakistan and concluded that bmi was a good indicator of overweight in the us context but bmi might be a better indicator for pakistanis it must be kept in mind that using data from the same survey prevalence of obesity can vary folds depending on whether national reference data or the international approach is taken in this study we found that in group and n cumulatively individuals had increased bp including individuals with prehypertension and with stage hypertension as defined by seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention detection evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure which is significantly higher than group n in which individuals had prehypertension p value less than this finding of rise in bp in group and is attributable to overweight obesity and is in accordance with studies conducted earlier our study has shown no significant difference among adult age group between rural and urban population which is contrary to hakeem r et al who have shown that urbanization contributed to obesity p value greater than there is another important finding that presence of overweight obese individuals in this study in which majority of participants were from rural settings in presence of higher food prices and growing poverty in pakistan suggests that other factors like lack of regular physical activity is a major contributory factors towards overweight obesity province wise maximum cases belonged to punjab n and out of them individuals had bmi kg m in our study most of the participants knew that overweight was related to different diseases when asked about what one can do to lose weight majority of the respondents listed exercise and dieting among their answers and mentioned dieting to lose weight thereby suggesting that participants had fair idea about effects of weight on health and healthy life style however considering this scenario of overweight obesity it is recommended that health awareness programs directed towards controlling weight including dedicated and sustained life style modification should be properly developed promoted and fully implemented it is important to highlight here that presence of overweight obesity in younger population predominantly belonging to rural setting in the background of inflation of food prices is of great concern and it is alarming sign to have frequency of overweight obesity among otherwise healthy adult males limitation of the present study is that subject population was not evenly distributed among provinces and predominantly belonged to rural settings further research is recommended to find etiological factors trends of obesity its correlation with metabolic abnormalities and means to effectively control weight in different age groups in larger scale studies thereby promoting healthy lifestyle conclusion frequency of overweight obesity was high among healthy adult males comprehensive health care awareness campaigns involving food intake regular aerobic exercise and maintaining weight is strongly recommended in younger population so as to promote public health reference bharmal fy trends in nutrition transition pakistan in focus j pak med assoc aziz s noorulain w zaidi ur

hyperlipidemic discussion in this observational study hyperuricemic men had higher gensini score showing association of uric acid with severity of cad we documented cad severity by coronary angiography which is the gold standard for diagnosis of ihd in the present study gensini scoring system has been used for assessing angiographic severity of ihd the gensini scoring system and the syn tax scoring system are the two most widely used scoring systems for assessing angiographic sever ity and complexity of ihd studies have proved their correlation and comparability with none of them inferior to the other gensini scoring system which first introduced in gives weightage to the proximity of lesions within the coronary tree in addition to the degree of stenosis the lesions in left main coronary artery getting the maximum score the final score is a true reflection of severity of ischemic heart disease as it sums up cumulative effect of all lesions it has also been shown to give more valuable prognostic information in a recent study in turkey deveci et al evaluated patients for association of serum uric acid with angiographic presence and severity of ihd using gensini score a statistically significant difference in the mean uric acid concentrations was found between the patients with and without coronary artery disease irrespective of sex also there was significant association of severity of ihd with serum uric acid levels in a similar study also from turkey a series of patients of stable ihd were studied by gur m et al for an association between hyperuricemia and angiographic severity of ihd using gensini score they observed positive correlation between serum uric acid levels and angiographic presence of ihd but not with severity of ischemic heart disease duran m et al studied non diabetic and non hypertensive patients of acs and found a positive association of hyperuricemia with angiographic severity of ischemic heart disease gensini score results obtained in these studies are comparable with our data xiong z et al found hyperuricemia to be prominently related to angiographic complexity not severity of coronary artery disease syntax score contrary to page of relationship of serum uric acid level and angiographic severity of coronary artery disease in male patients with acute coronary syndrome our results from china lu p et al reported that there was no relationship between serum uric acid levels and severity of ihd this study was done in stable ihd patients increased serum uric acid levels have been ob served in diabetics hypertensive obese and dys lipidemics a multiple risk factor clustering syn drome has been considered to be responsible for high serum uric acid level in ihd questioning the role of serum uric acid level as independent risk factor most studies in the past have excluded dia betics and hypertensives for the same reason in our study there was no statistically no difference in serum uric acid levels of diabetics vs non diabetics and hypertensives vs non hypertensives suggest ing the role of serum uric acid as an independent factor for severity of ihd in patients with acs hyperuricemia has also been studied as a marker of poor prognosis and increased mortality in general population other co morbidities and established ihd patients in a recent study by ndrepepa g et al of over patients with acs undergoing pci raised serum uric acid was associated with increased year mortality with increase in the adjusted risk for every mg dl increase in serum uric acid level and this increased risk was observed in all acs groups stemi nstemi and usa kojima s et al also showed that serum uric acid predicted the development of heart failure and long term mortality in acute mi this risk was even stronger in women uric acid in acs has also been shown to predict icu complications mortality in pre existing renal disease and contrast induced nephropathy in patients undergoing invasive procedures other than ischemic heart disease serum uric acid level has also been studied for association with other cardiovascular diseases like atrial fibrillation dilated cardiomyopathy calcific aortic stenosis and metabolic syndrome and results are convincing for these associations recent data has shown renewed interest in the inhibition of xanthine oxidase system for preventing progression of atherosclerosis allopurinol a xanthine oxidase inhibitor is being extensively studied for its role as add on therapy in stable ihd it acts by reducing vascular oxidative stress resulting in endothelial stabilization studies have also proven its beneficial effects in prolonging survival in patients with heart failure use of allopurinol is also associated with reduction in lv mass thereby indirectly relieving angina symptoms rajendra ns et al observed reduction in oxidative stress with allopurinol at tissue level but its translation into clinical benefit needs further data beneficiaries of allopurinol are not only the coronary arteries but the whole cardiovascular system reduction in ischemic strokes with use of allopurinol has also been reported in conclusion this study has shown association of severity of cad with hyperuricemia the limita tions of the study were only male patients serum uric acid level was done once study population was a limited number and it included only patients with acs it would also be interesting to follow up patients for prognostic significance and study the effect of varying uric acid levels references rathmann w funkhouser e dyer

factors for diabetes such as overweight obesity smoking hypertension and family history of diabetes increased over time in the young adults of rural baluchistan keywords obesity young adults diabetes jpma introduction the prevalence of chronic diseases is increasing worldwide with of the global burden to be contributed by the developing countries in the year million people with diabetes were estimated globally which is anticipated to rise to million by an upsurge in the cases of diabetes globally is mainly due to the rising prevalence of risk factors like age ethnicity overweight obesity physical inactivity and family history of diabetes more than billion adults worldwide are overweight and million of them are obese furthermore million people suffer from obesity related problems in developing countries a study analyzing the data from the national health survey of pakistan nhs showed that the prevalence of overweight adults was bmi greater than kg m whereas were found to be obese bmi greater than kg m similarly a study conducted in adults greater than years in the rural area of baluchistan year also demonstrated that of the population was obese page of changing pattern in the risk factors for diabetes in young adults from the rural area of baluchistan in a study in us in years age group it was observed that of the subjects were overweight and were obese similarly another study suggested that there was a significant increase in the incidence of obesity from at years of age to at young adulthood over a transition period of years the nhs showed that of the population was obese while overweight in years age group in pakistan both genetic and environmental factors seem to contribute to obesity however the major precipitating factor is environmental mostly related to sedentary lifestyle resulting in energy conservation as body fat several studies have suggested that being overweight or obese at a young age increases the risk of adulthood obesity and it has been proven that persistence of obesity in adulthood is a significant risk factor for chronic conditions like dysglycaemia dyslipidaemia hypertension and metabolic syndrome hence young adulthood is probably the most opportune period for intervention in order to prevent chronic diseases including diabetes in order to develop and target preventive efforts for young adults at risk of obesity and consequently diabetes we must identify the risk factors many studies examined risk for diabetes in adults but few focused specifically on young adults to our knowledge none of the studies in pakistan observed risk factors for diabetes in young adults at the same geographical location over a period of time therefore aim of the study was to observe changing pattern in the risk factors for diabetes such as overweight obesity smoking hypertension and family history of diabetes in young adults aged years in the rural area of baluchistan subjects and methods a community based observational study was carried out over a period of one year from february to february in the rural area of baluchistan province of pakistan the data obtained in survey was compared to a similar survey conducted in at

methodology have been reported previously in this study data of young adults was analyzed data obtained in was also analyzed according to the current guidelines ethical approval for the study was taken from institutional review board irb of baqai institute of diabetology and endocrinology all male and female young adults aged years who gave informed consent were considered eligible to participate and informed about the purpose of the study team for the surveys composed of doctors lady health workers lab technicians and paramedical staff all the selected participants were advised to come to a specified location after an overnight fast of hours after registration a fasting blood sample was drawn details of demography anthropometry smoking and family history of diabetes of the study participants were recorded on a proforma by doctors anthropometric measurement for height and weight was taken by paramedical staff weight was taken by a digital bathroom scale placed on a flat surface to the nearest of kg with subjects in light clothes and without shoes height was recorded to the nearest of cm while subjects standing in erect posture vertically touching the occiput back hip and heels on the wall body mass index bmi was calculated as weight in kg height in m bmi kg m and greater than kg m were classified as overweight and obesity respectively blood pressure was measured with mercury sphygmomanometer individuals were requested to take minutes rest at a sitting position before measuring blood pressure to reduce variation of blood pressure value with resting values hypertension was defined as blood pressure greater than mmhg hypertensives also included subjects with known hypertension who were already on antihypertensive medications prescribed by a doctor within

than from kg m in the year to kg m in the year the rise in the prevalence of obesity was the main contributing factor to significant increase p less than in the prevalence of diabetes from to in the rural area of baluchistan our study findings project an increasing burden of obesity in young adults in the rural areas and hence the risk it poses for the prevalence of chronic conditions including diabetes a study from pakistan showed that overweight or obesity was less in the rural compared to the urban areas this may be due to increased physical activity and less sedentary life style in rural community compared to their urban counterparts studies are needed in young adults in the urban areas of pakistan where increasing burden of obesity and other risk factors of diabetes are anticipated as a result of sedentary life style studies have also demonstrated that young adulthood is associated with an average weight gain of lb per year the largest gains are observed in the early to mid twenties particularly overweight individuals are at an increased risk in a study in china it was observed that the prevalence of overweight and obesity bmi greater than kg m increased by among adults aged years or older over a period of ten years hence young adulthood is the most opportune period for public health awareness campaigns and to target interventions as weight gain and obesity during young adulthood is associated with increased cardiovascular risk and diabetes later in life in our study family history of diabetes increased significantly over a period of seven years studies have demonstrated that overweight individuals with one or both biological parents with diabetes are at an increased risk of developing diabetes in adulthood although family history is a non modifiable risk factor for diabetes it can be used for risk stratification targeting interventions and positively influencing health behaviours in young adults hypertension is commonly associated with diabetes page of changing pattern in the risk factors for diabetes in young adults from the rural area of baluchistan findings of a study indicated that the risk of developing diabetes was fold greater in hypertensive individuals as compared to the normotensives systolic and diastolic blood pressures increased significantly in both male and female young adults in our study but interestingly hypertension did not show a significant increase however an increase in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures increases the risk of developing hypertension in the young adult population of rural baluchistan in later life we also found a higher proportion of young adults were cigarette smokers in survey which increased significantly from the year the association of smoking with type diabetes is not fully understood however it is suggested that smoking may cause insulin resistance in peripheral tissues number of cigarettes smoked per day increases the risk of type diabetes in a dose dependent manner smoking is a modifiable health risk behaviour and is generally established during adolescence and young adulthood therefore behavioural modification strategies should be planned specifically targeting young adults to counteract this mounting problem our study has some limitations we did not observe changes in the lifestyle of the young adult population of rural baluchistan over a period of seven years including changes in the dietary habits as well as physical activity levels conclusion the present study showed that risk factors for diabetes such as overweight obesity smoking hypertension and family history of diabetes increased in the young adults of rural baluchistan acknowledgement we acknowledge the support of merck marker pvt ltd for this survey we would also

gastrointestinal tract characterized by epigastric pain pain in right hypochondrium whose intensity usually increases while taking food the pain is sometimes relieved by food and milk there is itching between xiphoid and umbilicus nausea vomiting weight loss heart burn and hematemesis peptic ulcer may be due to an increase in acid secretion or a decrease in mucosal defence or both it occurs in lower oesophagus stomach and duodenum or in jejunum after surgical anastomosis with stomach up to the middle of s the major causes responsible for development of peptic ulcer were stress excessive secretion of acid eating too much fatty food rich food with spices and the use of alcohol and coffee page of factors associated with peptic ulcer a single centre experience at tertiary care hospital of khyber pakhtunkhwa later on other causative agents were also included to the list like helicobacter pylori h pylori use of non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids smoking co administration of corticosteroids and nsaids co administration of warfarin and nsaids heredity unusual causes like crohn s disease and tuberculosis or sometimes it may be idiopathic in united states peptic ulcer related mortality rate is in the admitted patients with respect to gender the prevalence rate of peptic ulcer is in males and in females in india the males are about eighteen times more susceptible than females in case of western countries the prevalence rate of duodenal and gastric ulcer is equal but in the tropical areas it is in the holy month of ramadan the incidence of peptic ulcer disease increases the main sites of the peptic ulcer disease include oesophagus stomach duodenum and meckle s diverticulum which contains the ectopic mucosa causing increased production of the acid so far main causes of the pud include h pylori use of nsaids gastrenoma cigarette smoking and stress in the usual relationships of the peptic ulcer incidents were attributed to smoking h pylori is regarded as to have role in the development of the peptic ulcer no study has previously been conducted in our set up to assess the association between peptic ulcer and major risk factors and their impact on the incidence of peptic ulcer the aim of the study was to find out association between peptic ulcer pu and high risk predictors like sex smoking use of non streoidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and h pylori infection methodology this descriptive hospital based study was conducted at the medical unit of the tertiary care hospital saidu sharif swat over a period of months from october to january seventy two patients of age above years with the established diagnosis of peptic ulcer based on upper gastrointestinal ugi endoscopy having risk factors like previous history of smoking at least months smoking history and with average of cigarettes day ingestion of nsaids and presence of h pylori infection were included in study all those patients of peptic ulcers having no risk factors or presence of risk factors other than risk factors mentioned were excluded from study all the patients were collected by purposive sampling technique after taking informed consent a detailed history was taken and general and physical examination were carried out in patients who were admitted in medical ward with signs and symptoms suggestive of peptic ulcer history of previous medications especially use of nsaids smoking habits h pylori infection confirmed by urease test were taken upper gi endoscopies were performed after having written consent and following standard protocol for ugi endoscopy only those with endoscopically proven peptic ulcer were selected for the study all the relevant data were collected on a structured proforma including patient s demographics clinical presentation of disease and associated major risk factors seventy two cases fulfilling the criteria were recruited during the study period data were evaluated retrospectively for the frequency of the disease causes of hospitalization percentage of duodenal and gastric ulcer along with the male to female ratio respective ward physicians diagnosed and treated the patients statistical analysis statistical analysis of results was performed for various variables by using spss version we used the standard direct logistic regression analysis where all explanatory variables were entered one by one simultaneously the current work particularly focuses on the significance of aforesaid predictors when a predictor is added or dropped from the model to assess the model fit we used the akaike information criterion aic while to check the explanatory power of the model we used negalkerke r results out of patients were male and were females with male to female ratio was the participants ages were in range of years

smoking has a predominant role as it has greater nagelkereke r score similarly nagelkereke r score for use of nsaids is involvement of h pylori and for sex in order to find out the probability of getting ulcer from different factors its coefficients are given in table iii discussion peptic ulcer disease is highly associated with h pylori in southern europe though some cases of peptic ulcers are not associated with h pylori and the use of nsaids peptic ulcer was observed to be more prevalent in the age of years and years in our study in the smokers and those who use nsaids for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis treatment of ischemic heart disease hypertension and general body aches however h pylori infection was found to be more prevalent in the age of years hence eradication of h pylori can be considered in patients of age years before the initiation of nsaids therapy as concomitant use in h pylori infection can aggravate the situation on the other hand very strong associations have been reported for concomitant use of nsaids and h pylori infection suggesting that h pylori eradication regimen may be initiated prior to use of nsaids nevertheless our observations showed strong association of getting chance of ulcers in smokers while taking into account the different parameters sex use of nsaids smoking and h pylori it is evident that smoking nsaids sex h pylori have high explanatory power for peptic ulcers thus the ordinal comparisons for different factors are smoking greater than nsaids greater than h pylori greater than sex moreover peptic ulcer is predominant in men than women our findings for the use of nsaids were nearly resembling the findings of hamid et al which say that nsaids and h pylori are regarded as the independent risk factors for development of peptic ulcer however we found highly significant association of smoking with peptic ulcer which may be attributed to the pharmacological action of nicotine and other constituents present in cigarettes hence awareness about giving up smoking is very important and shall be kept on priority basis for combating pepticulcer conclusion smoking has strong association for development of peptic ulcer than nsaids however associations for getting chance of peptic ulcer become more prevalent whence the use of nsaids h pylori infection and smoking is taken into account together smoking should be strongly discouraged and patients with peptic ulcer be warned of its hazardous effects moreover physicians may take into account smoking as major inferential associated

medical association march sunday copyright jpma all rights reserved section vol no length words byline syeda sadia fatima rehana rehman saifullah and yumna khan body abstract objective to assess and compare changes in pulmonary functions before and after exercise in young healthy adults methods the case control study was carried out from january to march on medical students aged years at bahria university medical and dental college karachi baseline values for forced expiratory volume fev and forced vital capacity fvc were measured with a digital spirometer and the fev fvc ratio was calculated the lung functions of group i comprising volunteers after aerobic exercise of minutes daily for five days over eight weeks was compared with group ii having controls who did not participate in any physical activity spss was used for statistical analysis result at the end of eight weeks there was a significant rise in fev to liters decline in fvc to liters and an increase in the fev fvc ratio to in group i students conclusion improvement in pulmonary functions was noticed as a result of physical activity keywords forced expiratory volume forced vital capacity fev fvc ratio jpma introduction exercise has been a means of testing the physical capabilities and physiological responses of an individual that form the basis of good health and well being it develops the ability to tolerate withstand stress and carry on in circumstances where an unfit person cannot continue lung function is an important predictive tool of both morbidity and mortality in medical practice the buffalo health study concluded that pulmonary function is a long term predictor of overall survival rates in both genders and can be used as a tool for general health assessment pulmomary function tests include the forced expiratory volume fev which is the amount of air exhaled in one second and the forced vital capacity fvc which is the maximum amount of air that can be exhaled in a single breath both fvc and fev are measured with the help of a spirometer later the fev fvc ratio which is the percentage of the fvc exhaled in the first second can be calculated exercise is a stressful condition that produces marked change in body functions improves endurance and reduces breathlessness skeletal muscles control many crucial elements of aerobic conditioning including lung ventilation the possible explanation could be that regular forceful inhalation and deflation of the lungs for prolonged periods page of physical activity and its effect on forced expiratory volume leads to strengthening of respiratory muscles there might be an increase in the maximal shortening of the inspiratory muscles as an effect of training which has been shown to improve lung function parameters as far as effect of exercise on lung functions is concerned recent developments in exercise physiology have shown significantly positive improvements however non significant associations have also been reported in view of the two contradictory studies authors were keen to know the role of physical activity in the modification of lung functions positive results if derived could then be communicated to the students for their fitness and well being subjects and methods the case control study was conducted at bahria university medical and dental college karachi from january to march subjects were assigned to groups cases and controls using a system of random number tables the sample size calculated was a minimum of and for controls and cases respectively after taking informed consent a detailed history was noted this was followed by a physical exam of each participant and those with a past medical history suggestive of asthma and exercise induced asthma smoking chronic cough recurrent respiratory tract infection history of chest or spinal deformity obesity and chronic obstructive lung diseases were excluded from the study pulmonary function tests and their ratio was measured for all the subjects before exercise with the help of a digital spirometer microlab electronic spirometer micro medical limited kent england standardised measurement procedures were used subjects seated comfortably were demonstrated the technique emphasising the tight fit between lips and tube and encouraging the subject to breathe out as long and forcefully as possible after one trial run the best of three technically satisfactory manoeuvres was recorded by a single experienced technician the ratio calculated by the spirometer was later confirmed manually the experimental group had student volunteers who performed aerobic exercise for minutes five days per week for eight weeks the exercise was supervised cycle ergometry with a target of moderate intensity performed on an electronically braked cycle ergometer medical graphics st paul mn the subjects pedalled at a rate of to revolutions per minute trained staff supervised and measured the pulmonary functions after each exercise session during the study candidates were left out had a fall in fev developed exercise induced asthma and left of their own accord the control group continued with the routine and performed no specific exercise the fev fvc and fev fvc ratio was then compared with pulmonary functions of the cases all the data was analysed with spss version values were presented as mean standard deviation and p value at less then was considered significant results there study included students with the mean age of years group i cases comprised students females and males group ii controls had students males and females the baseline fev fvc and fev fvc of all students represented the first set while the second set of readings in group i after exercise was compared with group ii there was no change in baseline pulmonary functions in the controls while fev was raised fvc was reduced and fev fvc ratio was raised in the cases table discussion physical activity vital for healthier existence is a complex behaviour that is nurtured by environmental and biological factors in day to day life moderate level of physical activity has a number of positive influences on all systems especially cardiovascular and respiratory page of physical activity and its effect on forced expiratory volume respiratory function depends on many factors including nervous system strength of respiratory muscles and lung dimensions there are different parameters used for the measurement of lung functions but fev has been proven to be most crucial in detecting pulmonary changes easily and effectively in clinical settings the patient turnover is high and in settings where obesity is prevalent another variable is the fvc which is the maximum volume of air exhaled with maximal effort with deep inspiration and predicts the compliance of lungs and the chest wall fev fvc fev is the ratio between the two and in healthy adults this should be approximately in our study improvement in fev after an week exercise course is comparable to a study in which significant augmentation in fev and fvc were observed after physical training in healthy male welders these results also agreed with a previous study which proved that ventilatory exercise programme improves all measured pulmonary parameters an association between physical activity and fev and fvc has been reported by previous studies in the general population men who remained active had higher fev and fvc than those who led a sedentary lifestyle another study found no correlation between pulmonary functions and physical activity our results correspond with a study that reported significant improvement in fev mean change of after one month of physical training in healthy volunteers from the jute and hemp industry as far as airways are concerned activity induced bronchodilation table comparison of lung function tests in study and control goups with and without exercise table comparison of lung function tests in study and control goups with and without exercise initial values eight week final values p value experimental group i control group ii experimental group i control group ii mean sd mean sd mean sd mean sd fev litre less then fvc litre less then fev fvc less then reduces airway resistance and improves pulmonary ventilation it is known that normally the volume and pattern of ventilation are initiated by neural output from the respiratory centre in the brainstem this output is influenced by input from chemoreceptors proprioceptive receptors in muscles tendons and joints and impulses sent by nerves to the intercostal and diaphragmatic muscles muscular exercise increases the rate and depth of respiration to improve fvc the consumption of oxygen and the rate of diffusion the increase in fvc post exercise might be related to the enhanced strength of respiratory muscles following training reduction in air trapping improvement in lung compliance reduced airway resistance reduced blood lactate concentration and improved lactate uptake by these trained muscles as fuel for their own activity along with a motivation which enforces the subject to take deep inspiration and fill all air passages after training it is well known that physical activity can help reduce bodyweight and increase muscle mass in the general population exercise training has been shown to improve respiratory capacity airway resistance exercise tolerance and work of breathing the study gives a clue to improvement in muscle strength endurance maintaining of positive pressure in the airways and improving the efficiency of ventilation with regular exercise we observed a slight fall in fvc an isolated finding which could be either due to variation in height age and weight of the participants spirometric measurements show a variability because the results are dependent on patient s efforts and consistency thus in order to reach an effective level of fvc people may have difficulty compared to producing fev restrictive lung disease is characterised by decreased fev and fvc and the ratio is often between of normal so an isolated fall in fvc cannot suggest restrictive lung disease according to the american thoracic guidelines the lower limit of normal lln is variable and patient values that are falling in close proximity should be interpreted with caution the diagnosis of restrictive disease is usually based on the presence of a reduced total lung capacity a reduced fvc in the presence of a normal fev fvc may be used to suggest but not to diagnose the presence of a restrictive abnormality page of physical activity and its effect on forced expiratory volume our study was the first research in the region done in order to analyse the effects of physical activity on lung functions in healthy adults it limitations included the small sample size inability to measure maximal oxygen uptake vo max forced expiratory flow and peak expiratory flow conclusion repeated periodic exercise helped in improving lung functions especially fev and ratio of fev fvc periodic measurement of fev can help in generating awareness regarding lifestyle modifications and acquiring a healthy habit of

accounting for approximately deaths or in every deaths each year cdc b c prevention of smoking initiation and cessation of smoking have become the national objectives to reduce morbidity and mortality

of cigarette smoking among adults has been attained by banning smoking in the workplace evans farrelly and montgomery restaurants and bars abc news world news tonight intensive anti smoking campaigns in the media flynn et al and tax increases usdhhs although the overall health benefits of quitting smoking are unquestionable the opposite trends of obesity and smoking in the united states have raised an important concern about an unintended effect of anti smoking policies on obesity rates chou grossman and saffer p claim that rising obesity is an example of the price that must be paid to achieve goals that are in general favored by society indeed the association between smoking and body weight has become a central issue in the obesity literature but the accumulating evidence is conflicting in this study we investigate whether quitting smoking leads to increasing body weight and to what extent we compile data for current and former smokers i e quitters from the and behavioral risk factor surveillance survey brfss the vehicle for our analysis is the treatment effect model barnow cain and goldberger to quantify the effect of smoking cessation we calculate treatment effects for sub samples of individuals our goal is to examine whether smoking cessation affects body mass index bmi differently by gender between age groups and among individuals with different lengths of time since quitting smoking literature much research has been conducted using the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes data albanes et al investigate the association between smoking and body weight using nhanes ii they find that cigarette smokers weigh less and are leaner than nonsmokers and ex smokers are not heavier or fatter than nonsmokers flegal et al employ data from phase of nhanes ill and conclude that smoking cessation is associated with a small increase in the prevalence of overweight although the effect was much larger among smokers who had quit within the past years using more recent nhanes data flegal finds that even substantial decreases in cigarette smoking have only a small effect generally less than percent on increasing the prevalence of obesity and decreasing the prevalence of healthy weight in the population earlier evidence of the link between smoking cessation and weight gain includes coates and li manley and boland klesges et al shimokata muller and andres moffatt and owens williamson et al klesges et al froom melamed and benbassat mizoue et al froom et al and hudmon et al the main limitation of the above studies is that inferences are potentially biased by unmeasured factors that simultaneously affect smoking or quitting and body mass if for example unobserved personal traits induce individuals to smoke and consume more calories the estimated effect of smoking on body weight will be biased unless endogeneity of the smoking decision is accounted for the absence of a mechanism in modeling endogeneity of smoking has challenged researchers attempting to confront it in various ways o hara et al estimate weight gains associated with smoking cessation in the lung health study a clinical trial which randomized smokers into a control group and an intervention group who received weeks of behavioral intervention eisenberg and quinn update the estimated weight gain upward using participation in the intervention program as an instrument main limitation of their analysis is lack of individual level page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey data which would allow calculation of standard errors for the instrumental variable iv estimates fang ali and rizzo study the relationship between cigarette smoking and obesity using data from the china health and nutrition survey and an ivestimation procedure to control for endogeneity they find a moderately negative relationship between cigarette smoking and bmi their quantile regression estimates reveal a weak association between smoking and bmi among subjects at the high end of the bmi distribution but the association is considerably stronger among subjects in the healthy weight range chen yen and eastwood examine the relationship between smoking and bmi employing a simultaneous equation system allowing for censoring and endogeneity of cigarettes smoked they claim that the negative relationship between smoking and bmi reported in the literature is attributable to simultaneity and should be interpreted with caution a shortcoming of the study is lack of identification strategy as no instrument is used in the cigarette smoking equation which may have contributed to statistical insignificance of the effect of smoking on bmi despite the ols estimates suggesting otherwise another line of research uses data from the brfss to estimate how much of the trend in obesity is explained by state specific factors including the price tax of cigarettes chou grossman and saffer employ a state fixed effects model to estimate the impact of cigarette price on bmi results link the upward trend in obesity to declining smoking rates gruber and frakes who control for the effects of unmeasured time varying variables with time dummies instead of a time trend criticize findings by chou grossman and saffer on the grounds that the state specific price of cigarettes is endogenous as it may be driven by market factors which affect both smoking and eating they use an alternative price variable state excise tax on cigarettes and obtain a strikingly different result from that of chou grossman and saffer a negative relationship between cigarette tax and bmi implying that reduced smoking lowers rather than raises body weight the estimated effects in both of these studies are as gruber and frakes p suggest implausibly large gruber and frakes find that individuals who quit smoking are percent less likely to be obese while smoking one fewer pack of cigarettes per day lowers the odds of obesity by percent the results of chou grossman and saffer are also enormous but in the opposite direction these mixed results reported in the literature call for a more in depth analysis of the effects of quitting smoking on body weight in this study we take a slightly different approach from that of chou grossman and saffer and gruber and frakes we investigate the role of quitting smoking directly rather than by way of cigarette prices or tax which determine smoking in weight changes by estimating a treatment effect model commonly used in program evaluation conceptual framework our empirical specification is motivated by a simplified consumer utility maximization theory similar to that in yen chen and eastwood philipson and posner and schroeter lusk and tyner conditional on socio demographics lifestyle and environmental factors such as state regulations on smoking in public places an individual derives utility from body weight and levels of food cigarettes and other goods consumed body weight is a function of food and cigarettes consumed conditional on socio demographic and lifestyle variables then maximizing the utility function subject to an income constraint produces the equations estimated in this study an optimum weight equation along with a cigarette smoking equation that is endogenous to the system instead of smoking we estimate a binary quitting equation prices of food are not available but regional and intertemporal variations in food prices are reflected in the regional and state variables used discussed next price of cigarettes is an important variable and drawing on gruber and frakes we use state excise tax on cigarettes as a proxy for price method econometric model treatment effect models have a long history of uses in program evaluation barnow cain and goldberger the model features a binary endogenous treatment variable d sub i for quitting smoking henceforth quitting by individual i which is modeled as probit d sub i if z sub i alpha u sub i if z sub i alpha u sub i less than or equal to page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey and appears as a regressor in the outcome equation for bmi y sub i log y sub i z sub i beta delta d sub i v sib i in and z sub i and x sub i are vectors of explanatory variables alpha and beta are vectors of parameters delta is a scalar parameter and the error terms u sub i v sub i are distributed as bivariate normal with zero means variances sigma sup and correlation rho the log transformed dependent variable ameliorates potential nonnormality and heteroscedasticity of the error term yen and rosiflski apart from the logarithmic transformation of y sub i and represent the recursive model with qualitative and continuous variables considered by maddala and lee p to investigate the differentiated effects of length of time since quitting smoking henceforth quit length on bmi the treatment parameter is parameterized as a linear function of quit length dummy variables w sub i with parameter vector gamma delta w sub i gamma this specification amounts to interacting the dummy endogenous variable d sub i with w sub i the model can be estimated by a two step or maximum likelihood ml procedure maddala and lee pp we use the more efficient ml procedure by maximizing the logarithm of the sample likelihood function for an independent sample of n observations maddala and lee p mathematical expression not reproducible in ascii where phi x is the probability density function and phi x is the cumulative distribution

errors of treatment effects are calculated by the delta method rao p data and sample our dataset contains individual level information on bmi smoking and quitting education and income levels lifestyle and employment status from the and behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss the brfss is implemented with collaborative effort of the cdc and state health departments interviewees were randomly selected to represent u s civilian noninstitutionalized adults age greater than or equal to we use the core component of brfss questionnaire which consists of a standard set of questions including queries about current health related perceptions conditions and behaviors e g health status diabetes page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey health insurance and tobacco use as well as demographics an important focus of the investigation was the effect of quitting smoking with different quit lengths on bmi changes therefore choice of the sample years was dictated by responses to an important question about how long has it been since you last smoked cigarettes regularly with a response ranging from less than month to years or longer such information was collected for and suspended for and available again for the original survey contained observations from and the first half of we focus on current and former smokers so individuals who had never smoked cigarettes are excluded as are observations with missing values in important explanatory variables also excluded are individuals from guam puerto rico and virgin islands pregnant women and those who don t know refuse to answer or had bmis exceeding six standard deviations above the mean restricting the sample to individuals age leads to observations for analysis note that although we use an unusually large sample from multiple years of brfss it is not possible to construct a panel a panel sample would allow examination of the dynamics of smoking quitting and accompanying weight changes to identify the model parameters and treatment effects our iv for quitting is a cigarette tax variable the tax burden on tobacco orzechowski and walker provides state level data on excise taxes of cigarettes we use the yearly data along with dates of changes in taxation rate to construct monthly state cigarette taxes these state tax data are merged to the brfss sample by state of residence and month interview time over average state excise tax increased from to cents per pack the largest increases observed in wisconsin and rhode island cents connecticut washington and rhode island had the highest cigarette tax rates in and cents while south carolina missouri and virginia had the lowest and cents respectively these dramatic differences in cigarette taxes among states and the sharp increase in average tax rate over a short period ensure enough variation in our identification variable in addition dummy variables for eight regions reference pacific are included in the quitting equation and states reference minnesota in the bmi equation the outcome variable bmi is a primary measure of obesity and is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared kg m sup as weight and height in the brfss are self reported bias is likely to arise cawley however finds no discernible differences between results from using self reported and predicted bmis in a different context viz effects of obesity on wages the other endogenous variable is a binary indicator indicating whether the individual had quit smoking technically quitters are individuals who had smoked at least cigarettes in their entire lives and their answer to the question do you now smoke cigarettes every day some days or not at all is not at all as noted above this potentially endogenous dummy indicator is interacted with dummy variables indicating seven categories of quit length see table and online tables which allow calculation of the effects of quit length on bmi we perform the analysis dividing the sample into three sub samples for each gender young females age middle aged females and old females and likewise for males average bmis are for young female male smokers and for young female male quitters average bmis are only slightly different among old female and male smokers but notably higher among the old female and male quitters about percent percent of the young females males are quitters the percentage of old females males who quit is percent percent the definitions and sample statistics of all variables are presented in tables in the online appendix and we summarize key figures there are notable differences in the explanatory variables between smokers and quitters across the six sub samples for example among young males average household incomes are for smokers and for quitters among old males percent of smokers reported excellent health compared to percent of quitters in the old female sample the percentage of college graduates is percent among smokers and percent among quitters among young females percent of smokers and percent of quitters and are married remarkable differences are also seen on employment race age and health coverage state cigarette taxes for quitters are higher than that for smokers for instance young female smokers reside in states that tax cigarettes at an average of per pack and young female quitters in states with average tax rate of importantly with a coefficient of variation of over percent for all samples the data provide ample variations in the tax rate variable to explain the quitting decision page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey results model estimation we estimate the treatment effect model for the six samples by ml method we estimate the log transformed model and find it preferable to the untransformed alternative not reported for each sample using a nonnested specification test one important empirical issue relates to uses of valid ivs viz proper exclusion restriction s to identify the model parameters and treatment effects for iv estimation parameter identification requires at least one variable that is correlated with the endogenous variable uncorrelated with error term of the outcome equation and does not affect the outcome conditional on its regressors angrist imbens and rubin for ml estimation of the current model however nonlinear identification criteria are met without exclusion restrictions owing to distributional assumption of the error terms nonlinear functional form inherent in the distributional assumption however often fails to generate sufficient variation to identify the model parameters so it is capricious to rely solely on distributional assumptions for identification to avoid over burdening the nonlinear functional form for parameter identification we impose exclusion restrictions specifically a state cigarette tax variable discussed above is included solely in the quitting equation since there is no a priori expectation that it would directly affect bmi french and popovici p note that cigarette taxes are by far the most popular iv used in the literature to estimate the effects of smoking on health mullahy and portney leigh and schembri and adult obesity rashad and that they prove to be excludable from the structural equation for a variety of dependent variables also included uniquely in the quitting equation are dummy variables indicating regions validity of these ivs is supported by testing for their joint significance in the quitting equation estimated separately by ml method for the purpose of these tests the hypothesis of weak instruments for cigarette tax separately and jointly with the regional dummies is rejected by likelihood ratio lr tests at the percent significance level for all but the old males sample table for this old males sample the tax rate variable turns significant when regional variables are excluded from the quitting equation this result provides a guidance for our estimation of the treatment effect model for old males viz for which regional variables are excluded from the treatment equation the above test for weak ivs is similar in spirit to that of staiger and stock for a more conventional model also see french and popovici we then test for exogeneity of quitting and the results are also presented in table the hypothesis of exogeneity rho is rejected by lr tests with p values for all samples ml estimates of the treatment effect model are presented in table for females and table for males cigarette tax our key instrument is significant at the percent level for middle aged males and females and at the percent level for all other samples the quit length variables are mostly significant in the middle aged and old age samples both females and males whereas such significance is sparser in the young females and young males samples obviously due to the somewhat restricted range in quit length due to age among some of the young individuals due to the large sample sizes most other explanatory variables are overwhelmingly significant in all samples with few exceptions the error correlation is significant at the percent level for all samples implying presence of unobserved factors that affect both quitting and bmi significance of the error correlation is consistent with results of the lr test for exogeneity above confirming endogeneity of quitting the effects of explanatory variables on the probability of quitting and on bmi conditional on smoking and quitting status are explored further by calculating marginal effects and results are presented in online tables effects of quitting smoking on bmi we calculate ates of quitting on bmi for females and males by quit length categories and also by bm categories each ate is an estimate of the expected gain in bmi for a randomly chosen individual in the defined bmi and quit length category we find ates vary relatively little by bmi category figures and tables available online compared with variations across quit length categories we therefore focus our discussion on ates by quit length the results page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey are presented in table and figure all ates are positive and significant at the percent significance level or lower for both females and males with two exceptions with very few exceptions in males age all estimated effects are greater than raw mean differences notably so in many cases for young females bmi increases by or percent within month after quitting smoking such bmi change increases by the maximum level of percent between and months and increases by a decreasing rate beyond months this pattern of bmi changes is also found in young males with maximum increase realized at years after quitting middle aged females and males maximum at years and old females and males maximum at over years overall across all age groups bmi increases as soon as quitting occurs although the magnitudes of increases are initially rather limited at a greater magnitudes months or longer after quitting the largest bmi increase in seen in old females at an increase of points percent over years after quitting smoking the effects of quitting on bmi differ notably between genders and age groups for instance between and months after quitting bmi increases by percent among women age percent among women age and by percent among women age the corresponding bmi increases are percent percent and percent among males such differences across age groups are also seen in the other quit length categories beyond years after quitting such differences among age groups become very pronounced for instance between and years after quitting the ates ranging from percent for young females to percent for old females are remarkably higher than the corresponding estimates within month after quitting which range from percent to percent figure omitted in sum our results contribute to the large body of existing literature and echo recent findings by eisenberg and quinn from a randomized smoking cessation trial that smoking cessation contributes to body weight overall we find that quitting smoking increases bmi that the effect increases with length of time since quitting and that the effects are generally more pronounced among females than males age greater than or equal to conclusion and discussion in this study we investigate the association between smoking cessation and body weight by addressing endogeneity of the former treating a potentially endogenous treatment as exogenous entails the risk of unmeasured or immeasurable variables confounding the estimates of the true causal effect of treatment on outcome such unobserved factors may relate to genetic or environmental influences that make quitters more or less prone to weight gain thus producing upward or downward biases in estimation of the treatment effect by endogenizing quitting the treatment effect model used in this analysis controls the unobserved confounders which might affect both quitting and bmi and can produce unbiased estimates for the model parameters and effects of quitting smoking on bmi the information on quit length is particularly useful in uncovering its differentiated effects on b mi changes our treatment effect estimates indicate that the gain in bmi from quitting is higher than the raw mean difference and that the effect differs by gender between age groups and by length of time since quitting smoking health professionals treating former smokers are concerned about the adverse weight increasing effects of smoking cessation especially among overweight and obese patients our estimates suggest that declining smoking rates have only a modest effect in the overweight population an increase in bmi by units percent among middle aged females with an average height in the overweight group months after quitting for instance translates into a kg increase in weight a middle aged male with average height and the sample quit length of months experiences a point percent increase in bmi which translates into a kg increase in weight a middle aged woman experiences the maximum increase of bmi points percent years after quitting which amounts to a kg increase in weight the effects of quitting on bmi are considerably lower among younger men and women page of smoking cessation and body weight evidence from the behavioral risk factor surveillance survey we conclude that the price that must be paid in terms of weight gain to enjoy the health benefits of smoking cessation is trivial even for the obese population this postcessation weight gain could be prevented with programs aiming at promoting physical activity in combination with nicotine replacement therapy parsons et al acknowledgments joint

bivariate analyses griffin more recently two multivariate studies have replicated these findings among diabetes patients with almost double the no show rates among nonwhite compared with white patients goldman friedin and cook schectman schorling and voss however there still remains skepticism regarding this association due to lack of adjustment for confounding by education socioeconomic status or facility effects in addition no study to date has had sufficient power to include hispanic or asian patients thus limiting generalizability to an important segment of the u s population ethnic differences in appointment keeping may play an important explanatory role in poorer health outcomes among minority patients as well as impact patient provider relationships health operations

hiatt and friedman krieger karter ackerson and darbinian this evaluation of appointment keeping behavior is a substudy of the diabetes study of northern california distance n a survey follow up study among an ethnically stratified random sample of kpnc members with diabetes designed to assess social disparities in diabetes related behaviors processes of care and health outcomes moffet adler and schillinger informed consent was attained from all respondents and the distance study protocol was approved by our institutional review board we included distance respondents if they had continuous membership for months following their survey date and self reported belonging to one of the five largest ethnic groups african american caucasian east asian includes chinese japanese korean and vietnamese filipino and latino in the health plan we excluded patients from ethnic groups e g native americans pacific islanders south asians too small to support statistical analyses patients with gaps in membership months and an additional percent of eligible patients who had no scheduled primary care appointments during the observation window appointment keeping measures outpatient primary care appointments appointments were identified during the months after the baseline survey from administrative records these included planned appointments for ongoing diabetes care as well as same day appointments for acute conditions we excluded all appointments that were cancelled in advance of the scheduled appointment time and appointments preempted by a hospitalization we did not include walk in visits at the urgent care or minor injury clinics by definition these visit types are not scheduled in advance and therefore any walk in visit is a kept appointment appointments were classified as planned if booked in advance as opposed to sameday appointments usually with the patient s assigned pcp as part of routine follow up a page of ethnic differences in appointment keeping and implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista missed appointment occurred when a patient had no primary care office visit within days of the planned appointment date so as not to penalize patients who managed to reschedule and attend in a timely fashion the missed appointment rate for each patient was calculated as the percentage of planned appointments during a month period that were missed approximately percent of the cohort had no missed appointments and the maximum number of missed appointments was the distribution for missed appointment rate was not normally distributed poor appointment keeping pak was defined as missing more than one third of planned appointments i e a missed appointment rate greater than or equal to in while there is no consensus regarding how to define inadequate appointment keeping for diabetes management petitti and grumbach griffin we felt that missing on average greater than one in three planned appointments should have a clinically relevant impact on continuity of care one that could impede the timely management of diabetes moreover this simple definition is easily calculated and thus could be implemented in almost any care setting as a validation we examined mean prebaseline low density lipoprotein ldl measures stratified by missed appointment rate we found statistically significant increases in mean ldl with every percent increase in missed appointment rate up to percent at which point the confidence interval for mean ldl crossed the clinically recognized target of mg dl and the increases asymptoted and no longer became statistically significant i e there were overlaps in the confidence intervals from that point forward similar results were found in an analysis of prebaseline glycosolated hemoglobin hbalc measures stratified by missed appointment rate data not shown therefore we felt confident that our cut point of greater than one third was clinically justifiable primary care appointments can also be scheduled on the day of the intended visit by the patient for acute or urgent care as part of open access policies this type of visit was classified as same day we measured the total number of booked and attended same day appointments for each patient during the months after the survey date from administrative records we also created an indicator variable for patients for whom a majority percent of outpatient care was delivered via attended same day appointments in addition we also measured the number of core specialty cardiology endocrinology nephrology neurology oncology surgery and urology appointments that were booked and attended during the same month follow up period clinical measures to assess the clinical relevance of pak we conducted a secondary analysis of change pre post in risk factor control by modeling postbaseline clinical outcomes as a function of missed appointment rate and prebaseline measures this included separate assessments of change in hemoglobin alc hbalc ldl and systolic blood pressure sbp each of which were captured via the kpnc electronic medical record we collected the last measure prior to survey date as the prebaseline measure and the last recorded measure available between the survey date and december as the postbaseline measure covariates we collected additional data on demographic

deprivation index using previously validated methodolgy messer laraia and kaufman by linking patients addresses geocoded at the time of the survey and linked to the u s census data administrative records were used to identify patients who had an assigned pcp the co payment due for an outpatient office visit and the kpnc service area a geographically clustered group of health care facilities which we refer to as medical centers for simplicity where the patient received most care health status was evaluated using a clinically and statistically validated comorbidity index the dxcg comorbidity index page of ethnic differences in appointment keeping and implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista statistical analyses the distance study used a stratified random sampling design that oversampled minority patients to provide adequate power for ethnic contrasts to account for this design effect we weighted analyses using expansion weights reciprocal of the nonproportional sampling fractions for each ethnic group in all multivariable models while we had no reason to believe that the relationship between ethnicity and pak would be different among survey responders versus nonresponders we opted to address survey nonresponse bias in the analysis as well using the horvitz thompson approach horvitz and source we first fit a model that predicted response to the distance survey and then created individual weights reciprocal of the probability of the observed response that were used in all multivariable models we included indicators for explanatory variables with missing survey responses and so as not to violate assumptions of linearity in the multiplicative models categorical variables were used instead of their continuous form modified poisson regression with a log link function and robust error variance was used to directly estimate relative risk rr zou of african american asian filipino or latino ethnicity relative to caucasians in models of the binary pak outcome the unit of analysis was the patient our modeling selection was based on the analysis of a directed acyclic graph dag a visual and rule based approach to capturing the causal relationships in a conceptual framework in this case with regard to the direct causal linkage between ethnicity and pak see appendix s we used established rules for dags to determine the minimally sufficient covariates needed to estimate the direct effect of ethnicity on pak maldonado and greenland hernan hernandez diaz and robins we show unadjusted results estimates from a model that controls for confounding by age and gender and estimates from a model that also adjusts for mediators of the ethnicity to pak effect adjusting for these mediators blocks indirect causal pathways and isolates the independent and direct effect of ethnicity on pak the mediators included education income assets social support depression employment lep inadequate functional health literacy having an assigned pcp trust in provider medical center age of diabetes onset comorbidity risk score dxcg and competing demands we also assessed effect modification by testing for interactions between ethnicity and the following age gender and medical center to evaluate the clinical relevance of pak we modeled postbaseline clinical outcomes using two sets of cutpoints hbalc percent ldl mg dl and sbp mmhg and hbalc percent ldl mg dl and sbp mmhg to determine whether pak was independently associated with poor risk factor control while the majority percent of clinical measurements was collected after the month observation window we used to determine appointment keeping behavior we ran a sensitivity analysis excluding the small percentage of subjects whose measurements were collected concurrently with the pak measure and found no difference in the results we present analyses from the larger cohort below a potential shortcoming of our pak measure is that it fails to include same day appointments when they occur with a patient s assigned pcp our reasoning was same day appointments are motivated by patients health concerns typically to address acute needs whereas planned primary care visits are requested by providers at optimal intervals to ensure sufficient chronic disease monitoring and prevention and are a cornerstone of the pcmh model however the distinction between same day and planned primary care blurs because medical centers with open access policies and flexible scheduling systems do try to match patients with their pcps for same day appointments and these visits may time permitting include chronic disease monitoring and prevention to address this concern we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of pak as missing more than one third of all appointments same day or planned with the assigned pcp and we defined same day appointments as only those with providers other than the pcp another limitation is that a single missed appointment for patients who scheduled less than three appointments would be categorized as pak however excluding patients with scheduled appointments conferred no substantive differences in findings results sample characteristics page of ethnic differences in appointment keeping and implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista the study cohort included diabetes patients with the following ethnic breakdown caucasian percent african american percent latino percent filipino percent and asian percent table as expected there were pronounced socioeconomic and clinical differences by ethnicity in this sample african americans and latinos reported lower annual incomes and had a greater percentage of total assets than other groups thirty five percent of latinos did not receive a high school degree and over one third of both latinos and african americans lived in deprived neighborhoods filipinos and latinos had the poorest glycemic control whereas african americans shouldered the highest burden of dyslipidemia and hypertension depressive symptoms were common in all groups baseline prevalence ranged from a low of percent in asians to a high of percent in latinos the groups with the greatest disease burden based on percentage of the sample with a dxcg risk score in the upper quartile were african americans filipinos and caucasians characteristics of patients with pak in the months of follow up percent of patients missed over one third of their planned appointments i e classified as pak pak was more common in patients who were younger less educated had fewer assets and lived in deprived neighborhoods table twenty one percent of those with pak also missed of appointments in the year prior to the distance survey having an office visit copay lack of trust in provider or not having an assigned pcp were also associated with pak patients with pak booked and attended fewer planned appointments than those with good appointment keeping gak table and these differences were statistically significant p for both however there were no differences in the mean number of same day appointments that were booked or attended between the two groups only percent of patients with pak attended at least two primary care visits in the month postsurvey compared with percent of patients with gak forty four percent of pak patients received a majority of their care at same day appointments as compared with percent for gak patients with pak also had lower utilization of specialty care than patients without pak the above mentioned relationships persisted in models that adjusted for demographic socioeconomic and clinical and facility effects ethnic differences in utilization of care in unadjusted analyses african americans and latinos booked and attended more planned appointments than other ethnic groups table but these differences became nonsignificant in multivariable models a similar pattern was seen for same day appointments however higher utilization in african americans and latinos remained statistically significant after model adjustment nineteen percent of latino patients received the majority of their care at same day appointments compared with percent for african americans and caucasians percent for filipinos and percent for asians african americans and caucasians attended the highest mean number of specialty appointments during the follow up period ethnic differences in pak poor appointment keeping rates differed more than fold across ethnicities and were as follows percent ci in latinos percent in african americans percent in filipinos percent in caucasians and percent in asians compared with caucasians latinos and african americans had and percent increased risk respectively of pak in a model adjusting for age and gender table no substantive risk differences between asians or filipinos and caucasians were observed note that while caucasians are commonly used as a reference group for ethnic comparisons they had the intermediate level of pak and thus mask the full range of differences that is when comparing the highest latinos with the lowest rates asians in the fully adjusted model model the estimates attenuated however the risk for african americans rr ci and latinos rr ci compared with caucasians was still elevated and statistically significant p and p respectively in a model adjusting for ethnicity age gender and total number of scheduled outpatient

implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista we found a statistically significant interaction between ethnicity and medical center p but neither age nor gender was an effect modifier of the ethnicity pak relationship in stratified analyses pak rates among cancasians were similar across medical centers range percent but african american and latino rates varied widely range and percent respectively table when we compared the ethnic groups with the highest to lowest rates of pak at each medical center the unadjusted relative risks ranged from no difference rr to a fold increased risk of pak by ethnicity with the exception of medical centers and we have adequate representation of all ethnicities in each center i e patients per ethnicity per site and therefore feel that variation due to small sample size is of minimal concern clinical consequences of pak in a lagged cross sectional analysis patients with pak were at and

outpatient appointments the relative risks ci for hbalc percent ldl mg dl and sbp mmhg associated with pak were as follows and with p values of and respectively we also ran models with indicators of poor clinical control using higher cut points as the influence of pak may differ across disease severity the relative risks ci for hba c percent ldl mg dl and sbp mmhg were similar in direction and magnitude to the lower cut points and respectively sensitivity analysis we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of pak missing more than one third of the total planned appointments and same day appointments with the assigned pcp and an alternate definition for same day appointments only those with providers other than the pcp the mean proportion of same day visits among all attended visits declined markedly using this definition percent which was expected given that approximately half of the attended same day appointments are with a patient s pcp however our primary study findings remained unchanged the patterns and magnitude of ethnic differences in pak persisted receiving the majority of outpatient care via same day appointments was still the strongest independent predictor of pak and the associations between poor glycemic ldl and sbp control and pak held we also conducted sensitivity analyses defining pak in two different ways using a lenient cut point missing any planned appointments and using a stricter cut point missing percent planned appointments our results were robust to these changes discussion to our knowledge this is the first study to evaluate ethnic differences in primary care appointment keeping in a large ethnically diverse diabetic patient population with uniform access to health care our study is unique in that we had sufficient sample size to disaggregate minority ethnicity and examine utilization patterns separately we observed substantial ethnic differences in pak with the highest rates among latinos and african americans these differences were not fully explained by the confounders and mediators included in our models i e demographics education socioeconomic status and patient provider relationship trust in provider previously thought to account for these findings medical center was an effect modifier of the ethnicity pak association pak was associated with a percent greater rate of poor control for the major cardiometabolic risk factors hba c ldl and bp underscoring the public health relevance of these findings our results suggest that ethnic differences in pak are not spurious and deserve more attention while offered care and total utilization were for the most part uniform across ethnic groups in this health care setting after adjustment for demographic socioeconomic and clinical risk factors latinos and african americans were at much higher risk of missing planned visits in as much as planned visits are scheduled with providers to ensure a proactive approach to disease management and prevention of comorbidities pak may represent missed opportunities for treatment intensification and preventive care even for patients with seemingly adequate overall utilization based on visit number latinos and african americans were more likely to have negative perceptions of page of ethnic differences in appointment keeping and implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista their pcp communication style i e reporting they were not patient centered or relationship centered and were more likely to be in ethnic discordant patient pcp dyads data not shown previous research has shown that satisfaction may be poorer among vulnerable populations rothschild where differences in patients and providers social class i e social distance may reinforce stereotypes give rise to unintentional discrimination van ryn and burke sequist fitzmaurice and marshall or in the case of this study foster differential utilization patterns among ethnicities appointment keeping may also be influenced by patients attachment styles with regard to the patient provider relationship which may differ across ethnic groups ciechanowski russo and katon we found variability in ethnic specific pak rates across medical centers despite the largely uniform standards of care at kpnc another study also indicated that site of care was an important determining factor in missed appointment rates in a community clinic setting lasser mintzer and lambert site specific structural features potentially identifiable and modifiable may influence ethnic differences in appointment keeping behavior a recent review article which examined the effect of open access scheduling found that in practice its implementation was imperfect in real world scenarios outcomes varied across sites no show rates improved only in practices with a high prevalence percent of missed appointments at baseline and there was some evidence suggesting that patients were more likely to be lost to follow up in open access systems rose ross and horwitz site differences in the availability and type of same day appointments e g extended evening and weekend hours pcp or non pcp may give rise to unexpected utilization patterns e g considering same day visit as compensating for needed scheduled appointments and potentially increase ethnic disparities in this study we saw a greater propensity among some ethnic groups particularly latinos to use same day appointments and this was strongly predictive of pak rr even after adjusting for disease severity perceptions of the importance and purpose of planned versus same day primary care appointments may differ between health care providers and patients some patients may have a preference for using same day services as acute problems arise at the expense of preventive primary care visits other patients may not distinguish between planned and same day visits and consider them interchangeable for example if a patient has recently seen his her pcp at a same day visit s he may consider the upcoming planned appointment as optional or unnecessary conversely a patient who misses a planned appointment may subsequently make and attend a same day appointment with the pcp to compensate for the no show whichever is the directionality the quality of care provided may differ between the two visit types even if the pcp attends both planned primary care appointments in diabetes maintain continuity of care by evaluating risk factor control and the need for treatment intensification rodondi peng and karter schmittdiel uratsu and karter monitoring adherence to and tolerance of new medications and checking for depressive symptoms as well as complications same day appointments are typically intended for patients with acute illness or injury even in cases where the pcp conducts the same day appointment health care providers are trained to listen to patient complaints typically requesting symptom relief before imposing an agenda thus time constraints may leave little time to focus on the preventive diabetes care agenda that would dominate a visit planned by the pce as a result patients who are habitually seen at same day rather than planned primary care appointments may receive less preventive care or have less continuity with one pcp thus undermining a personal ongoing patient provider relationship that has been shown to improve glycemic control dearinger wilson and griffith we also found evidence suggesting that pak may negatively impact outcomes as it was associated with a percent increased risk of inadequate control of hba c ldl and sbp in models that adjusted for prebaseline clinical control continuity of care with a pcp is particularly critical for patients with diabetes if certain ethnic subgroups are receiving the majority of care through same day rather than planned primary care visits it may further the disparities commonly observed in blood pressure lipid and glycemic control karter ferrara and liu brown gregg and stevens kirk d agostino and bell chew bradley and boyko even though the evidence is suggestive caution is needed when inferring from these observational data that poor attendance actually caused a worsening of control nonetheless our data confirm that pak is clearly useful as a marker of poor clinical control karter parker and moffet schectman schorling and voss page of ethnic differences in appointment keeping and implications for the patient centered medical home findings from the diabetes study of northern california dista our study has numerous strengths including many potential explanatory variables from a large ethnically diverse cohort collected via self report and electronically however some limitations should be mentioned given that our findings are based on survey responses from a sample of patients with diabetes selection bias e g survey nonresponse bias could reduce generalizability however we controlled for selection bias by incorporating survey nonresponse weights in the multivariable analysis in addition we have no reason to believe that the relationship between ethnicity and pak would be different among survey responders versus nonresponders given the slightly higher rate of missed appointments in survey nonresponders percent compared with responders percent it is likely that our estimates are conservative and biased toward the null we studied a fully insured population and so interpretation of the findings is limited to this group however approximately one third of northern california s residents are members of kaiser permanente and so our study results should have wide applicability finally as in all observational research residual confounding due to unmeasured or poorly measured factors is possible our study suggests that the poorer intermediate health outcomes commonly observed in african americans and latinos with diabetes may be attributable to some extent to pak pak was associated with increased utilization of same day appointments and was also predictive of poor clinical outcomes in a lagged cross sectional analysis while this study s objective did not include identifying the reasons for ethnic differences in pak we did find that the size of these disparities varied across medical centers future research needs to evaluate the tension between facility level structural features e g providing greater convenience and access via extended hours for same day appointments and missing planned primary care appointments those trade offs may impact ethnic groups differently and perpetuate disparities in unexpected ways these results may have important implications for public health and health plan policy as managed care settings rapidly expand open access to care supported by the pcmh model rittenhouse and shortell on an individual level heavier use of same day appointments was associated with higher likelihood of missing planned appointments research is needed to evaluate the impact of health care system level structural changes including whether increasing availability of same day appointments at medical centers via open access could actually increase the rate of missing planned appointments for the care of chronic diseases whether expanding same day access increases pak in planned appointments in a way that is detrimental for health outcomes for chronic disease and whether these negative impacts and are amplified in medically vulnerable populations if so it will be crucial that pcmh develop systems to monitor that quality of care will not be compromised among patients who prefer same day appointments as a substitution for planned appointments given our disparate findings across ethnic groups we will also need to monitor outcomes separately across populations to ensure that open access is not compromising care for medically vulnerable subgroups finally interventions to address pak deserve special attention given the

and laboratory workup the goal of treatment is to delay or prevent cvd and diabetes the national cholesterol education program ncep adult treatment panel iii atp iii report identified a constellation of factors that increased an individual s risk of developing cardiovascular disease cvd metabolic syndrome is a general diagnosis given to a set of disorders that a patient experiences simultaneously including hyperglycemia elevated bp dyslipidemia and abdominal obesity in the united states approximately of adults have been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome as obesity rates increase the incidence of metabolic syndrome is also expected to rise the damaging effects of metabolic syndrome may place affected patients at a higher risk of developing cvd and type diabetes mellitus t dm the exact societal cost of the syndrome is unknown because the disorder can vary so much however given that the annual projected costs associated with hypertension diabetes cholesterol disorders and obesity are escalating one can expect that the annual cost associated with metabolic syndrome will be astronomical sullivan and colleagues estimated the loss in productivity resulting from metabolic risk factors was billion annually page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome boudreau et al studied the health care utilization of patients with metabolic syndrome and found that the cost of care for patients with diabetes who were obese and had dyslipidemia and hypertension was almost twice that of patients with prediabetes who had the same risk factors compared with major organizations such as the american heart association aha and the american diabetes association ada do not agree on the usefulness of metabolic syndrome in clinical practice several studies have testified to the significance of the syndrome as a diagnostic predictor of cvd yet many highly acclaimed scientists refute the validity of the syndrome to predict cardiovascular or diabetes risk as postulated by others in the medical community reaven adamantly believes the syndrome is a pathological process and challenges the scientific world to stop spinning the notion that it is anything more despite the rather intense battles about the utility of a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in clinical practice most parties agree that the risk factors associated with the syndrome are problematic for the patient public health and health care providers components of metabolic syndrome while not all organizations agree on the requirements for diagnosing metabolic syndrome table there is consensus about the factors that should be considered these include whether the patient is obese or overweight lipid levels bp and the presence or absence of insulin resistance obesity in women the metabolic syndrome affects of overweight persons and of obese and extremely obese individuals slightly more than of normal weight and underweight persons have the syndrome in men with metabolic syndrome only were in the normal weight category with more than in the overweight or obese category metabolic syndrome is linked more to central visceral obesity than to overall obesity several studies cite central obesity as the pivotal component in development of the syndrome the proposed connection between obesity and the risk factors for metabolic syndrome are complex increase in visceral fat leads to central obesity and has been linked to increased insulin resistance as a result of hormonal influences also cortisol has been widely studied as a culprit in stimulating the appetite for high carbohydrate fatty foods that lead to increased deposition of fat around the abdomen the hormones thought to play the greatest role in the development of obesity related metabolic syndrome are the adipokines leptin and adiponectin the hormone leptin helps regulate appetite and storage of fat and influences thermogenesis to burn calories sudden increase in weight or extreme weight gain disturbs the leptin regulation thereby allowing deposition of fat in the visceral areas as well as inciting an increase in triglyceride storage in vital organs such as the heart muscles and liver dyslipidemia in obese patients with metabolic syndrome deregulation of the hormonal system often leads to dyslipidemia levels of the hormone adiponectin were found to be inversely related to visceral fat and lower in patients with coronary artery disease adiponectin promotes insulin sensitivity and has an antiatherogenic effect the patient with metabolic syndrome usually has normal levels of ldl although the lipoproteins themselves are believed to be denser and smaller in nature which makes them more atherogenic levels of triglycerides and hdl are often elevated in the patient with metabolic syndrome insulin resistance in insulin resistance the body produces insulin but it is not used properly this cyclic dysfunction leads to higher glucose levels in the bloodstream which causes more insulin production hyperinsulinemia an increase in total body fat is independently related to insulin resistance scientists believe that adipose tissue releases additional adipokines that are insulin antagonists such as tumor necrosis factor alpha tnf greekalpha interleukin il and resistin these inflammatory factors are responsible for insulin resistance the production of c reactive protein crp and increased adhesion of wbcs and molecules to endothelial cells page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome hypertension hyperinsulinemia and obesity in metabolic syndrome raises patients risk forelevated bp elevated insulin levels increase the kidney s absorption of sodium and water which in turns increases blood volume and elevates the bp obese patients require a larger than normal cardiac output because of increased blood volume in addition sympathetic system in obese patients is overactive leading to constriction of peripheral arteries sodium retention and vascular resistance the presence of any of these actions alone or synergistically can lead to hypertension in a group of organizations released a set of diagnostic criteria on which they agreed table the organizations involved were the international diabetes federation idf task force on epidemiology and prevention the national heart lung and blood institute the aha the world heart federation international atherosclerosis society and the international association for the study of obesity consequences of metabolic syndrome in many individuals with insulin resistance hormonal imbalance and obesity are interrelated resulting in even more devastating consequences of the metabolic syndrome santos and fonseca found that metabolic syndrome was more prevalent in patients with inflammatory disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus sle and rheumatoid arthritis the researchers also discovered increased incidents of atherosclerosis in this same subset of patients in a post hoc analysis of the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis afonso et al discovered that of the four groups studied no metabolic syndrome and no microalbuminuria microalbuminuria only metabolic syndrome only and metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria the group with both metabolic syndrome and microalbuminuria had higher levels of inflammatory markers and more subclinical atherosclerosis than the other groups further studies have shown that patients with metabolic syndrome demonstrate increased stiffness in precapillary vessels which impedes subcutaneous microcirculation and makes cardiac events more likely investigators for the strong heart study proved that patients with metabolic syndrome had a higher in hospital death rate after acute st elevation mi zhao et al determined that in patients with metabolic syndrome progression of coronary stenosis was increased by and frequency of cardiovascular events was increased by compared with those without the syndrome in addition to increased cardiovascular risk metabolic syndrome has been linked to polycystic ovary syndrome pcos sleep apnea dementia and fatty liver moreover recent studies have linked the metabolic factors of obesity elevated glucose and increased triglycerides to the development of macrosomia obesity and metabolic syndrome in the unborn child clinicians will have to rethink the care of the pregnant woman insisting on lifestyle interventions to prevent the passage of unhealthy metabolic conditions to her child tenenbaum and fisman reported that patients with metabolic syndrome and hyperglycemia had higher mortality rates than patients with the same level of hyperglycemia and no metabolic syndrome they also reported a day mortality rate of vs p respectively towfighi zheng and ovbiagele reported that the incidence of stroke has more than tripled for women in the past years and they attribute this increase to the rising incidence of obesity in a meta analysis that included patients and studies mottillo and colleagues found that metabolic syndrome was associated with a twofold increase in cardiovascular outcomes and a fold increase in all cause mortality after analyzing the data from individuals in the reasons for geographic and racial differences in stroke regards study brown voeks bittner and safford found that of the participants had metabolic syndrome with such large numbers of patients falling into the metabolic syndrome category the need for standardized diagnostic criteria and treatment protocols persists even in the midst of the controversy over the syndrome s characteristics and utility screening guidelines page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome the assessment of patients suspected of having metabolic syndrome should include a physical examination a dietary history and laboratory workup physical examination during the initial visit measure the patient s waist and calculate the bmi measurement of waist circumference is important because adiposity is related to cardiovascular risk obesity is defined as a bmi and overweight is defined as a bmi of to a bmi of to indicates normal weight however a study of participants revealed that the method used to define obesity whether by body fat percentage truncal obesity measurements or bmi did not change the prevalence of metabolic syndrome indicating that all measurements were equal coutinho et al analyzed patients with coronary disease and found that increased waist circumference was associated with increased risk of death hazard ratio hr confidence interval the study showed that central obesity was associated with an increased risk of death regardless of bmi thirty percent of all deaths in the study were attributed to central obesity independently thereby confirming the need to measure both bmi and waist circumference to more adequately determine risk category and tailor treatment to the individual bmi can easily be calculated in adults once the height and current weight are plugged into the formula weight lb xc height in x the nih classifications of obesity should be used only as a general guideline as there are ethnic specific considerations of obesity that should be applied to each patient rahman and berenson found that increased percentage of body fat and obesity among white black and hispanic patients corresponded more with a bmi and respectively therefore counseling on ways to prevent obesity should begin long before the patient reaches a bmi of after the bmi has been determined a screening waist circumference should be obtained with the provider standing on the patient s right side the patient s right iliac crest is palpitated and marked and then a vertical line is drawn from the mid axillary line the measuring tape is then placed in a horizontal plane at the level of the mark the tape should be parallel to the floor and the measurement should be taken during normal respiration according to guidelines in the seventh report of the joint national committee on prevention detection evaluation and treatment of high blood pressure jnc a screening bp measurement should be taken in the office while the patient is seated with the arm at the level of the heart two separate readings are obtained and elevated readings are confirmed in the contralateral arm every office visit should include bp measurement and assessment of risk factors or other comorbidities a systolic bp of to mm hg and diastolic bp of to mm hg is considered prehypertension bp readings mm hg in patients with diabetes or kidney disease are a risk factor for metabolic syndrome and readings mm hg are a risk factor for those without chronic disease bp readings mm hg require treatment often with more than one antihypertensive bp screenings are recommended every two years in patients aged years and older diet and exercise history the next step in the assessment for metabolic syndrome is to document a diet and exercise history overeating and inactivity are known risk factors for obesity discussion with patients should address barriers to exercise support systems and their readiness to change their current regimen open ended nonjudgmental questions such as how do feel about exercise rather than do you exercise will provide the clinician with more useful information to help determine the patient s needs unbiased comments will also help establish trust with the patient establishing a trusting relationship with the patient can help both patient and provider meet short and long term goals for weight loss a careful food consumption history should be taken on the first visit as well review of the diet history will give clues as to what dietary habits need improving and provide an estimate of the number of calories consumed that information will be important when determining an appropriate caloric goal laboratory studies assessment for metabolic syndrome includes screening for lipids during normal stress levels as acute illness increased stress and eating within nine hours of testing can produce falsely elevated results a page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome complete lipid profile should be obtained including ldl normal mg dl hdl normal mg dl triglyceride normal mg dl and total cholesterol normal mg dl levels additional tests to rule out other differential diagnoses of elevated lipid levels include serum thyroid stimulating hormone blood urea nitrogen creatinine liver function tests and urinalysis once the lipid level is obtained assess the risk of coronary heart disease the framingham risk assessment can be used to determine the patient s risk factors for coronary heart disease or a cardiac event in the next years diabetes peripheral vascular disease abdominal aortic aneurysm and symptomatic carotid disease are considered risk equivalents for cvd in the framingham risk calculations other framingham risk predictors are age total cholesterol hdl smoking antihypertensive treatment and bp points are assigned to each risk factor and the total number of points determines ldl levels at which to begin therapeutic lifestyle changes and drug therapy the risk factors are stratified separately for men and women note that framingham risk calculations underestimate cardiovascular risk in patients with t dm so be cautious about using them in that subset of patients in addition sumner and colleagues have challenged the validity of the previously stated lipid classifications for metabolic syndrome as they relate to blacks the triglyceride and cardiovascular risk in african americans tara study showed that even obese insulin resistant black patients often have low triglyceride levels of the study participants were insulin resistant but only had high triglyceride levels the researchers stated that in comparative studies of whites with insulin resistance also had elevated triglycerides moreover the researchers believe that both the idf and the aha criteria miss many blacks who are at risk for metabolic syndrome the oral glucose tolerance test ogtt is the most sensitive assay for detecting overt t dm in patients with prediabetes however performing this test in the office setting is time consuming therefore a fasting glucose determination is used more often patients with a history of impaired fasting glucose ifg or impaired glucose tolerance igt should be screened every one to two years for t dm balkau et al proved that serum glucose levels were more predictive of diabetes than was an hba c determination in however the ada added an hba c determination to the tests for diabetes levels are diagnostic the levels of serum glucose and ogtt results diagnostic of diabetes were unchanged at mg dl and mg dl respectively a random blood glucose mg dl that is accompanied by complaints of increased thirst urination hunger and fatigue is considered a positive indicator of diabetes ifg which is a risk factor for metabolic syndrome is defined as a blood glucose reading of to mg dl treatment of metabolic syndrome the goal of metabolic syndrome treatment is to delay or prevent cvd and diabetes treatment of metabolic syndrome and its risk factors focuses on healthy lifestyle interventions such as exercise and a nutritious diet patients whose metabolic syndrome persists may try behavior modification or pharmacotherapy exercise vigorous activity for to minutes at least five times a week but preferably daily is recommended to aid in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight the diabetes prevention program study showed that for at risk persons a loss of approximately of body weight could prevent or delay development of diabetes or other metabolic disorders resistance training in particular has received a great deal of attention in the treatment of metabolic syndrome it was found to have a null effect on triglycerides hdl ldl and diastolic bp but resistance training has been shown to decrease systolic bp hba c and obesity the aha recommends resistance training two days a week in addition to behavioral changes in a physical activity regimen using a pedometer to track exercise taking the stairs and reducing the amount of time spent in such sedentary activities as watching television can all be effective in reducing body weight page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome weight reduction results in improvement of all metabolic risk factors therefore providers are encouraged to tailor an exercise regimen based on the patient s individual characteristics and specific risk factors that predispose him or her to metabolic syndrome patients with metabolic syndrome who are at high risk for cardiovascular events should be medically supervised in their physical activity some may require an exercise stress test to detect life threatening abnormalities before initiating an exercise program the oslo diet and exercise study revealed that diet and exercise together produced the greatest reduction in the incidence of metabolic syndrome after one year metabolic syndrome affected of the diet and exercise group in the diet only group and of the exercise only group similarly yassine et al found that exercise and caloric restriction vs exercise alone produced greater weight loss kg xb kg vs kg after controlling for diet increased physical activity was most associated with a decreased likelihood of developing metabolic syndrome in the finnish diabetes prevention study healthy diet treatment of metabolic syndrome also includes eating a proper diet the mediterranean diet consists of a lot of green leafy vegetables fiber fish olive oil and nuts low intake of saturated fats trans fats and cholesterol has proven to be effective in aiding weight loss in patients with metabolic syndrome reducing daily caloric intake by to calories along with exercise will help place the body in a calorie deficient state so that weight loss can occur a reduction in consumption of refined sugars sodium and high glycemic food can aid in weight loss as well much attention has been given to studies showing that consumption of diet drinks leads to metabolic syndrome and increases weight gain scientists hypothesize that the artificial sugar increases cravings for other refined sugars leading to weight gain and disruption of glucose metabolism also patients with elevated lipid levels should keep fat intake in the range of to of calories fat intake has the potential to increase ldl whereas levels will cause hdl to decrease and triglycerides to increase a consultation with a dietitian can help the patient reach preset goals patients with a history of kidney disease should refrain from high protein diets because reduced renal function can ultimately lead to insulin resistance behavior modification another important approach to maintaining weight loss is behavior modification providers should encourage patients to read all food labels set goals for weight loss keep food diaries or journals and be active in their journey to a healthy weight for patients who are unable to achieve weight loss after a reasonable time such as six to months of aggressive lifestyle interventions a trial of oral weight loss medications may be beneficial orlistat xenical is the only drug approved by the fda for weight loss maintenance bariatric surgery is another option for obese patients weight loss surgery can be recommended for patients with a bmi or a bmi with comorbid conditions medications treatment of dyslipidemia in metabolic syndrome centers around the goal of reducing ldl with lipid lowering medications the revised atp iii recommends an ldl of mg dl for high risk patients and mg dl for those at moderate risk the ldl for patients at low risk is mg dl which is unchanged from the original guidelines once the primary goal of ldl reduction is reached the secondary goal is to reduce elevated triglycerides the tertiary goal is to increase hdl if levels are mg dl for men and mg dl for women the year risk of a first cardiovascular event averages to in metabolic syndrome patients recent studies have evaluated the positive effect of statins which include reduction of ldl and the inflammatory marker crp in metabolic syndrome patients statins combined with fibrates have the additive effect of reducing triglycerides and increasing hdl but this combination has the potential to cause myopathy therefore patients will have to be monitored closely other combinations such as fenofibrate and nicotinic acid can be considered great concern over the use of nicotinic acid in patients with metabolic syndrome continues because one of the side effects is possible elevation of blood glucose thus providers are cautioned to use the smallest effective dose of nicotinic acid in patients with dyslipidemia and prediabetes page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome more recently the presumed positive effect of niacin combined with statins has been scarred by the discontinuation of the aim high trial the high dose niacin and statin combination reduced triglyceride levels and raised hdl levels but there was no reduction in heart attacks strokes or hospitalizations for acute coronary syndrome there was a small increase in ischemic stroke with niacin use the usefulness of raising hdl has been questioned with the discontinuation of this study leaving many researchers searching for another marker of lipid control beyond ldl controlling blood sugar ifg and igt are also risk factors for metabolic syndrome that should be treated initially with lifestyle interventions as previously stated a weight loss of to of total body weight greatly reduces the patient s potential to develop diabetes exercise improves insulin sensitivity and aids in weight loss reducing caloric intake by calories avoiding refined sugars and following a healthy diet will also be beneficial to the patient with ifg or igt the drug metformin has also been proven to slow down and impede the development of diabetes in patients with metabolic syndrome the ada does not routinely recommend treatment of insulin resistance in the absence of diabetes instead the organization states that treatment can be considered in patients who have a bmi are younger than age years or have ifg and igt plus other risk factors however once t dm develops the recommendation is to use a combination of therapies including lifestyle modifications and medications to achieve an hba c to reduce risk of cvd addressing bp lowering bp to mm hg is important in reducing the chance of cardiovascular events in patients at risk for metabolic syndrome lifestyle modifications are the starting point in any treatment related to hypertension control the findings in the jnc support use of the dietary approaches to stop hypertension dash diet weight loss and moderate alcohol intake to reduce cardiovascular risk also according to the guidelines patients with a history of diabetes should aim for a bp mm hg several drug combinations for the treatment of hypertension and metabolic syndrome have been studied but no one combination has supremacy over another researchers have supported the use of angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors in patients with metabolic syndrome especially those who also have ifg or igt diuretics have been proven to reduce cardiovascular risk but there is debate about progression to frank diabetes in those who have ifg or igt hypertensive blacks with metabolic syndrome respond better to thiazide diuretics than to ace inhibitors as first line therapy based upon findings of the allhat trial thus clinical judgment is required to produce results that will bring the patient s bp to goal other considerations the prothrombotic state and the proinflammatory state in metabolic syndrome are also recognized as major risk factors for cvd the proinflammatory state involves elevation of cytokines and crp weight loss improves the inflammatory response coagulation factors increase in patients with metabolic syndrome aspirin is a low cost medication that can help prevent the likelihood of stroke in women and mi in men if there are no contraindications aspirin should be considered for women aged to years and men aged to for primary prevention of cvd according to the us preventive services task force the daily use of aspirin will reduce the relative risk of stroke in women by and the relative risk of mi in men by there is no consensus on the aspirin dosage either mg or mg can be considered however the higher dose is linked to gi bleeding implications for practice health care providers must suspect that patients with any one of the five metabolic risk factors can have other hidden risk factors that are silently working together to exacerbate the situation this suspicion should lead to further inquiry into family and personal medical history consideration should be given to prescriptions for lifestyle modifications investigative diagnostic procedures and therapeutic medications as deemed appropriate the components that make up metabolic syndrome are at page of a practical guide to metabolic syndrome epidemic levels in the united states and as waistlines are continuing to increase solutions to this global problem are urgently needed this paper has provided a review of the metabolic syndrome and reported guidelines that can be utilized in the office setting with continuing research modifications in the recommendations for metabolic syndrome can be expected the turbulent atmosphere surrounding the syndrome may continue but as long as the goal is improvement in patient outcome the medical community will have to put aside differences and treat patient as a whole and not as a set of debatable numbers jacinta thomas aprn c practices internal and family medicine in atlanta and is a student in the

male medical students pak j med sci introduction in today s era of health conscious society and increasingly educated population the health lifestyle and behavior of a doctor has become significant overweight and obesity is today s highly visible yet neglected public health problem and is known to have negative bio psycho social effect and affects various organ systems in the body including lungs page of impact of overweight and obesity on ventilatory function among male medical students negative impact of obesity on respiratory function through several mechanisms has been shown by various studies the most common abnormalities reported are decreased expiratory reserve volume and functional residual capacity due to reduced chest wall and lung compliance and increased respiratory resistance it is also believed that increased pulmonary blood volume leads to congestion resulting in thickening of the airway wall thus reducing airway size many studies find that lung function as described by the forced expiratory volume in one second fev and or forced vital capacity fvc is inversely correlated with general pulmonary and cardiovascular mortality and morbidity medical students of today are the health caretaker of the society tomorrow their own health status would significantly affect their influence on the society today s overweight and obese youth expect prevention counseling during their visit to physician so medical students of today should take care of their own health and be bio psycho socially healthy before their practical life as a health care provider the aim of our study was twofold to determine the predominant pulmonary function abnormality in male medical students who are otherwise healthy and free from serious or chronic diseases and to assess the correlation between the severity of lung function impairment and the degree of obesity methodology this cross sectional study was conducted at king khalid university hospital and college of medicine king saud university riyadh kingdom of saudi arabia we enrolled male medical students of years age studying at college of medicine during the study period august july exclusion criteria during the consultation participants were excluded if having signs and or symptoms of obstructive or restrictive airway disease out of enrolled male medical students did not fulfil the study criteria and were excluded from the study pulmonary function one hundred and thirteen students completed the study criteria and were reffered for pulmonary function test forced vital capacity fvc and forced expiratory volume in one second fev and ratio of fev fvc were used as a pulmonary function test the evaluation of pulmonary function test was performed by using vitalograph gold std model no by vitalograph ireland limited ennis co clare republic of ireland after calibration at liters and temperature calibration at room temperature after instruction each subject performed a minimum of two forced expiratory maneuvers to provide estimates of forced vital capacity fvc and fev forced vital capacity is the maximum volume of air expired during forced expiration and is primarily an indicator of lung volume fev is the volume of air expired in the first second of forced expiration and is influenced by lung volume and airflow obstruction tests were carried out standing and without nose clips the higher values of the two readings for fev and fvc were used for analysis we defined a ratio of fev to fvc an indicator of airflow obstruction of less than as low possible chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd was defined on the basis of an fev fvc of less than body mass index bmi body mass index is an index of weight for height that is commonly used in classifying overweight and obesity in adult populations one of the investigators general physician took the anthropometric measurements of participants while they stood in light clothing without shoes using a standard protocol height was measured to the nearest cm using a free standing stadiometer weight was measured to the nearest gram using digital scales we used world health organization who classification reference for

spirometry reflects total compliance which has contributions from both the lung and chest wall the fev reflects these same factors plus airway resistance an important observation of this study is a

linear trend between bmi and fvc fev and fev fvc ratio is mildly to moderately positive this positive trend could be due to the higher proportion of normal subjects in this study another interesting observation is the linear trend of bmi which is more positively correlated with fev than fvc leading to a significant decrease of fev fvc ratio significant decrease in fev fvc ratio in relation to increasing bmi is alarming and is a sign of obstructive lung disease these results are consistent with several previous epidemiologic studies in a cross sectional study of adults aged above years found negative association between bmi and pulmonary function among overweight and obese while bmi was positively associated with fvc and fev in normalweight subjects similar findings were observed among indian male and females of years of age sekhri v et al in a recent study of morbidly obese patients found a significant impact of increased bmi on the forced vital capacity fvc forced expiratory

correlated with body size compared with waist hip ratio whr or waist circumference wc bmi is a more convenient measure is less likely to be influenced by sex or degree of obesity and can easily be applied in large scale epidemiologic studies however it does not reflect visceral adiposity in a better way or separate out contributions of increased abdominal mass hence several studies used waist hip ratio whr or waist circumference wc as an indicator of obesity and assessed the impact on pulmonary function canoy et al compared the relations of wc whr and bmi with fvc and fev and found that

strengths including narrow age range at entry and high quality of data collection through strict quality control across examinations limitations of the study were related to recruitment we examined only male aging years hence we did not recruited female children or elderly population another limitation was related with definition of obesity we used bmi to classify obesity as per international classification and did not look at the distribution of body fat by wc or whr conclusion our study found an inverse relation between bmi and pulmonary function among overweight and obese male medical students who had no previously known any serious or chronic disease the clinical importance of the magnitude of association between bmi and pulmonary function observed in the current study is not

characteristic of middle age according to dr arlene l hankinson of the department of preventive medicine at northwestern university chicago and her associates that finding from a longitudinal study that tracked men and women during the year transition from young adulthood to middle age highlights the value of incorporating and maintaining at least minutes of activity into daily life the investigators said the investigators undertook their study because public health guidelines recommending regular exercise have been largely based on cross sectional observational and short term clinical evidence that cannot account for the changing risk of weight gain with increasing age the investigators noted moreover it had never been shown that federal guidelines advocating minutes of moderate to vigorous daily activity are sufficient to prevent weight gain during the transition to middle age when the highest risk of weight gain occurs they wrote jama dr hankinson and her colleagues examined data for subjects who were years of age at baseline in regarding self reported participation in specific sports exercise home maintenance and occupational activities at all activity levels men and women alike showed gains in weight body mass index and waist circumference during years of follow up some age related weight gain may be unavoidable in our society as it has been observed even among a population of vigorously active runners through middle age the researchers noted however habitual daily vigorous activity was associated with smaller increases in mean

has set a goal for the year of of adults achieving and maintaining a healthy weight yet currently only of the u s population is classified at a healthy weight the obesity epidemic will significantly affect the clinical laboratory in terms of increased testing for associated chronic diseases glucose tests lipid evaluations cardiac evaluations and other routine procedures performed to evaluate health status and specific disease treatment for these individuals will increase without changing the disease screening protocol due to the current prevalence of obesity in adults and children the incidence of obesity related chronic diseases will increase over the next to years when they are diagnosed among the baby boomers reaching middle and old age obesity can be diagnosed easily using body mass index bmi calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters classifications range from underweight bmi lt and normal bmi to to overweight bmi to and obese bmi greater than or equal to the latter category has been subdivided by some researchers into obesity bmi to and extreme obesity bmi gt others have classified obesity into class bmi to class bmi to and class bmi greater than or equal to page of understanding the obesity epidemic what does the lab need to know while bmi is an effective assessment of excess weight measurements such as waist circumference hip circumference and waist to hip ratios are also important in identifying fat distribution because the location of excess fat has been linked to increased risk for heart disease and diabetes risk factor for chronic disease obesity is a risk factor for type diabetes hypertension gallbladder disease and osteoarthritis all of which lead to increases in the overall burden of disease in the population consume more healthcare dollars decrease productivity in the workplace reduce quality of life and increase mortality high blood pressure is the most common overweight and obesity related condition the risk of these various conditions increases as weight increases for type diabetes gallbladder disease and high blood pressure the increase in prevalence is more substantial for individuals younger than it is almost inevitable that an individual who is severely obesewill develop a significant chronic disease those with bmis of greater than or equal to when compared to normal weight individuals are

quality of life measures for individuals after reaching years of age in a study of men and women who were followed for years and who completed the hsq normal weight individuals had better scores scores worsened as bmis increased these inverse associations were stronger for physical functioning than for mental health or social well being higher proportions of men and women who had bmis lt in middle age reported their health to be excellent or good when they reached compared to those who were overweight or obese in middle age mortality obesity related causes of mortality are second to those of tobacco use which caused deaths in the united states in at their current rates of increase obesity and overweight soon may overtake tobacco usage as the leading cause of death in this country the centers for disease control and prevention estimated annual deaths due to poor diet and physical activity i e obesity to be in using published prevalence estimates and relative risks this represents a significant increase over the estimate of annual deaths due to obesity in the physician s health study following a cohort of male physicians for five years men with a bmi of greater than or equal to had a higher risk of death compared to men of normal bmi defined in this study as to page of understanding the obesity epidemic what does the lab need to know results of the health professions follow up study following male health professionals for years demonstrated that bmi and waist circumference were strongly related to death from cardiovascular disease and coronary heart disease in men younger than in men over waist circumference was strongly related to death due to cardiovascular and coronary heart disease in the nurses health study following a cohort of female nurses for years women with a bmi greater than or equal to were more than twice as likely to die as women with a bmi of greater than or equal to as bmi increased mortality due to coronary heart disease chd cardiovascular disease cvd and cancer was evident for mildly overweight women with a stronger association between increasing weight and mortality due to chd and cvd than to cancer cost of medical care the united states spends more on healthcare than any other industrialized country with obesity related costs a significant component in of medical spending was attributable to obesity and overweight the public sector medicare and medicaid covers almost half of this medical spending attributable to obesity increased between and of the increase was due to diabetes hyperlipidemia and

by and class obesity nearly doubles them prevalence in adults the prevalence of overweight and obesity has increased significantly over the last years from to the obesity rate was compared to from to a recent study from to identified a combined prevalence of for overweight and obese for obese and for extremely obese obesity was more prevalent in women of color for all age groups in the adult population non hispanic black women had the highest level of extreme obesity compared to mexican american women and non hispanic white women of particular concern is the increase in prevalence of extreme or class obesity between and class obesity increased from to it was highest among black women and individuals who had not completed high school and the prevalence was twice as high among short

obesity requires those individuals identified in these categories to expend more calories than they consume while it is a recognizably difficult task to lose weight and equally difficult to maintain weight loss americans do not routinely follow preventive recommendations of reducing calories and increasing physical activity sufficiently to lose weight from a study in using self reported height weight and diabetes diagnosis in which of participants were obese were diabetic and were both obese and diabetic of overweight participants and of obese participants were not trying to lose or maintain weight among those who were trying to lose or maintain weight only were reducing caloric intake and increasing physical activity for all participants surveyed of adults did not engage in any physical activity and were not regularly active only of participants reported they ate fruits and vegetables at least five times per day these data demonstrate that treatment of obesity depends in large part on the individual s willing participation in his own healthcare program and highlights the need for a different emphasis to improve the effectiveness of the treatment protocol therapy changing childhood behavior the data for overweight and obese children is troubling since childhood behaviors are difficult to change in adulthood preventing childhood obesity and early onset adult chronic diseases such as type diabetes is critical the public education system provides an opportunity to encourage children to decrease their risk of obesity one study incorporated lessons into the grade school curriculum beginning with student self reporting of time spent watching television and videos and playing videogames after abstaining from these activities for days the students were then advised about selecting seven hours of programming for their weekly television viewing budget no replacement activity was introduced for the time without media use this intervention group reduced their media viewing by and had statistically significant reductions in bmi waist circumference and waist to hip ratio as adjusted for the growth and weight expected in children of this age this type of program combined with lessons on nutrition and physical activity and reinforced with physical fitness opportunities and healthy food choices in the school cafeteria has the potential to decrease the prevalence of childhood obesity therapy adult physical activity adding an exercise program improves the clinical effects of obesity related chronic diseases for any age group physical fitness is a key component to reducing the sequelae of excess body fat and to reaching and maintaining a healthy weight significantly reduced physical fitness levels are associated with increased coronary artery risk factors more angiographic coronary artery disease and increased risk for cardiovascular events in women undergoing coronary angiography one recommendation for maintaining healthy weight is participation in minutes of daily exercise equivalent to brisk walking in one session or in increments throughout the day weight loss for obese women in an month randomized trial was greater for those who had access to home exercise equipment and exercised in short page of understanding the obesity epidemic what does the lab need to know incrementsthese women exercised an average of minutes weekly compared to minutes weekly for those without equipment significant weight loss was achieved among those exercising more than minutes weekly although weight gains generally occur in mid life women who increase their activity levels either through sports exercise or daily routine gain less excess weight sustaining weight loss is imperative for treatment success and positive outcomes are best realized through daily exercise with easily accessible equipment therapy diet increased consumption of dietary fiber is associated with higher hdl high density lipoprotein lower ldl low density lipoprotein and lower fibrinogen as well as decreases in weight gain insulin levels central adiposity blood pressure and hypertriglyceridemia consumption of specific nutrients appears to facilitate weight loss for example calcium particularly that derived from dairy products decreases the incidence of insulin resistance syndrome and obesity in a study of obese individuals who consumed a calorie deficit diet with specified varying amounts of calcium weight reduction and abdominal fat loss were proportional to the amount of calcium ingested and were greatest weight loss and abdominal fat loss for those individuals who consumed calcium in dairy form to be absorbed in appropriate quantities however calcium requires vitamin d without adequate vitamin d the small intestine absorbs only to of dietary calcium with adequate vitamin d of calcium is absorbed obesity is often associated with a vitamin d deficiency and obese individuals are considered to be chronically deficient since vitamin d is found in large fat deposits and consequently is not readily bioavailable a number of popular diets including atkins ornish weight watchers and zone provide a structured plan for weight loss in a control trial following obese adults mean bmi of randomized to one of these four diets for one year each diet only produced a modest weight loss mean of to kg sustaining the diet was difficult of the participants did not complete the one year study the role of the laboratory currently laboratory testing plays a limited role in diagnosing and treating obesity however because clinical laboratory test results identify the clinical consequences of obesity hyperglycemia in diabetes hyperlipidemia and elevated hs c reactive protein in heart disease risk assessment incorporating these types of tests into protocols based upon an individual s bmi may identify individuals at risk for these diseases at an earlier stage this epidemic provides the clinical laboratory an opportunity to work with clinicians to develop protocols to identify sequelae of obesity and monitor treatment outcomes instead of following the current recommendations of performing lipid profiles and glucose analyses every five years physicians could use the bmi score to decide whether to perform more frequent chronic disease testing and to determine whether testing improves the health of these individuals for example using a reflexive type of testing protocol glucose and lipid profiles could be performed biannually for individuals with bmi gt and annually for those with bmis of gt further testing would be based upon initial test results no studies have examined the benefit of performing more testing based upon bmi score however staff or group model types of hmos health maintenance organizations with their self contained provider and patient populations provide an ideal environment to perform such an evaluation as part of this evaluation including cost benefit analyses is necessary to determine if increased testing improves both identification and more importantly treatment outcomes for those at risk for obesity related chronic diseases identification and understanding of the biochemical manifestations of obesity are in their infancy as the details of endocrine regulation of energy metabolism are better understood assessment of hormones such as leptin ghrelin adiponectin and resisting may become more prevalent for identifying individuals with genetic causes of obesity and monitoring weight loss treatments using new drugs developed from this understanding as technology becomes

media inc all rights reserved length words body obesity often is stigmatized as a condition blamed solely on lifestyle choices and overeating but is that true for all people now a polygenic score for obesity developed by the broad institute may enable clinical laboratories to help doctors determine their patients inherent risk for becoming overweight throughout their lifetimes researchers at the broad institute of massachusetts institute of technology mit and harvard have developed a genetic test that they suggest could be used to predict a persons risk for obesity from birth through adulthood given the role of obesity in a wide range of diseases and health conditions development of a genetic test panel for obesity would give clinical laboratories a way to help physicians with this health condition experts believe there would be strong consumer and physician demand for the test after clinical studies validate these early findings dark daily previously covered the use of polygenic scoring to determine risk for chronic diseases in polygenic scores show potential to predict humans susceptibility to a range of chronic diseases new clinical laboratory genetic tests could result from latest research could medical laboratory test quantify a persons susceptibility to obesity the broad institute scientists published their study polygenic prediction of weight and obesity trajectories from birth to adulthood in the journal cell co first author amit v khera md associate director precision medicine unit at the massachusetts general hospital center for genomics medicine cgm and associate director cardiovascular disease initiative broad institute of mit and harvard believes early intervention could help ward off health conditions associated with obesity such as diabetes heart disease and stroke you can overcome your genetics but some people have to work a little harder than everyone else to maintain a normal weight khera told pbs according to a broad institute news release khera and his associates designed a genome wide polygenic score that uses more than two million common genetic variants to quantify a persons likelihood of becoming obese they found nearly a pound weight difference between middle aged adults with the highest and lowest scores and a pound plus weight difference in year olds with scores at opposite ends of the spectrum in addition they note the polygenic scores effect on weight emerges early in life and increases into adulthood page of broad institutes new genetic test could predict a persons risk for obesity from birth through adulthood to develop the polygenic score the researchers compiled data from the bmi genome wide association study on obesity using new computational algorithms they distilled the information into a single numberor scorefor each individual the scoring algorithm was validated based on data from individuals in the uk biobank and then used to explore obesity in additional groups totaling more than individuals from the uk biobank framingham offspring and coronary artery risk development in young adults study and the avon longitudinal study of parents and children noted the broad institute news release experts views on obesity test vary not all scientists are convinced the broad institutes genetic centric approach to studying obesity is time and money well spent in all fairness we dont know whether all of these variants really matter epidemiologist cecile janssens professor at emory university told pbs when asked about the value of doing a study like this she said i have no clue other experts question whether a genetic test for obesity would change patient behavior this kind of personalized risk information has little to no impact on peoples actual behavior theresa marteau phd director of the behavior and health research unit at the university of cambridge told npr which also pointed out that of the people in the broad institute study with the highest scores had normal body weights nevertheless some doctors are positive about the broad institutes new tool i hope this work will hopefully destigmatize obesity and make it very similar to every other disease which is a combination of both lifestyle and genetics research team co leader sekar kathiresan md co director program in medical and population genetics at broad institute told npr this analysis of the heritability of obesity could lower stigma by making it clear that weight gain is not the result of laziness poor choices or a lack of willpower he added while more studies will need to be done to validate the use of a polygenic scoring in fighting obesity the broad institutes research provides a foundation for developing such a test an fdaapproved predictive genetic test for

heart association says that could be good for your heart smoke free policies have been linked to lower systolic top number blood pressure readings among non smokers according to aha researchers we found that nonsmoking adults in the study who lived in areas with smoke free laws in restaurants bars or workplaces had lower systolic blood pressure by the end of the follow up period compared to those who lived in areas without smoke free laws said stephanie mayne ph d study lead author and research scientist at policylab and the center for pediatric clinical effectiveness at children s hospital of philadelphia the study was conducted while mayne was a postdoctoral fellow at northwestern university s feinberg school of medicine although laws that prohibit smoking in public places like bars and restaurants have been associated with reduced rates of hospitalization for heart disease previous studies have not examined changes in blood pressure in this new analysis researchers linked data from the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia study to state county and local smoke free policies in restaurants bars and workplaces smoke free laws were associated with reduced systolic blood pressure but surprisingly not with reductions in diastolic blood pressure or high blood pressure mayne explained it s not entirely certain why this was the case but it s possible that we are detecting effects on systolic blood pressure that are below the threshold for hypertension higher systolic blood pressure increases the risk of cardiovascular disease even when numbers are below the hypertension threshold so the reductions in systolic blood pressure seen in this study suggest a potentially meaningful effect on population level risk she added while the magnitude of associations was small at the individual level researchers said the results point to a potential mechanism through which reductions in secondhand smoke due to smoke free policies may improve population level heart health the cardia study enrolled black and white adults age to in from four u s cities birmingham alabama chicago minneapolis and oakland california page of smoke free

the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia study which contained repeated assessments of marijuana use and kidney outcomes the team found that at the start of the study individuals with higher marijuana use had lower kidney function upon follow up however marijuana use was not associated with change in kidney function over time or the appearance of albumin in the urine which is a sign of kidney damage results from our observational study in young adults with normal kidney function may not translate into a clinically meaningful difference and may be insufficient to inform decision making concerning marijuana use however it is possible that the association between marijuana use and kidney function could be different in other populations such as older adults or patients

zainab hasan and masood anwar qureshi body abstract objective this study investigated the relationship between cardiorespiratory fitness crf and adiposity in young adults methods data was collected from students of a medical college of pakistan the study was conducted on young adults aged years recruited from jinnah medical and dental college karachi between aug dec queen s college step test was conducted to measure crf and maximal oxygen uptake vo max evaluated anthropometric measurements body mass index body fat visceral fat waist circumference were taken to assess adiposity associations of

quartiles of vo max showed strong inverse relationship between adiposity and vo max obese individuals having low vo st quartile and normal weight individuals having high vo max th quartile vo max correlated greatest with body fat in males r p and waist circumference in females r p conclusion the results indicate low crf in young females and a strong inverse relationship between fitness levels and adiposity in young adults of both genders improving these parameters in our young population may prevent development of chronic non communicable disease in later life keywords adiposity cardiorespiratory fitness exercise health education introduction cardiorespiratory fitness crf also referred to as aerobic capacity is one of the most important components of physical fitness it is the ability of the body to perform dynamic large muscle exercise for prolonged periods at moderate to high intensity maximum oxygen consumption vo max is considered to be the most widely accepted measure of crf giving a baseline estimate of one s heart and lung capacity and can be used to follow the progress of daily physical exercise studies have shown that high levels of cardiorespiratory fitness in young adults is associated with a lower risk of having calcification in the coronary arteries and prevents the development of early atherosclerotic vascular disease physical inactivity and sedentary behavior leads to accumulation of excess adipose tissue and a state of chronic inflammation which is a major factor in the development of non communicable diseases ncd data from page of cardiorespiratory fitness and its association with adiposity indices in young adults the pakistan demographic and health survey shows that approximately of the youth bulge in pakistan is between the ages of and years comprising mostly of college and university students the physical activity levels in this age group are not enough to prevent ncd in later life regular physical exercise increases crf levels and suppresses the chronic inflammatory state of obesity lowering the risk for ncd measurement of vo max is therefore considered an important part in the evaluation of the cardiores piratory health and aerobic fitness sophisticated laboratory equipment is required to measure aero bic capacity directly however it can reliably be estimated indirectly by performing submaximal exercise protocol such as the three minute step test despite the importance of crf and its role in prevention of ncds in later life there is lack of studies performed locally data on adiposity in young adults is also lacking additionally it is important to analyze data on crf and adiposity measures using gender disaggregation as there are pulse rate beats min differences in disease risk and implication this paper provides a baseline evaluation of crf levels adiposity and their gender based correlations methods this was a cross sectional study conducted on young adults aged years recruited from jinnah medical and dental college karachi between aug dec all subjects completed physical activity readiness questionnaire a simple questionnaire designed to make sure that there are no obvious reasons that a person should see a medical doctor before becoming much more physically active written informed consent was taken from each subject and the study was approved by the research and ethical committee of jinnah medical and dental college karachi pakistan weight was measured to the nearest kg with a digital scale with the subject wearing light clothing and without shoes height was recorded to the nearest cm seca stadiometer body mass index bmi was calculated as a ratio of weight kg divided by height m and classified using the asian criteria as proposed by western pacific regional office of world health organization the waist circumference wc was determined while standing at the midpoint between the top of the iliac crest and lower margin of last palpable rib to the nearest cm bioelectric impedance analysis was done to determine body fat and visceral fat omron hbf body composition monitor normal range for body fat was taken as for males and for females cardiorespiratory fitness was measured by submaximal exercise testing using queen s college step test a reliable method to indirectly estimate vo max the equipment consisted of a sturdy bench inch high a stop watch and a metronome set at beats min for males and beats min for females the subjects were asked not to perform vigorous exercise twenty four hour before and not to take food caffeine or smoke two hour before testing resting heart rate hr was noted for one minute the subjects were then asked to step up and down in rhythm with the metronome for three minutes radial pulse was counted five seconds after stopping for a period of seconds and multiplied by four to get the pulse rate min this recovery pulse rate was used in the following equation to determine the subject s vo max and read on an age adjusted rating scale in males vo max ml kg min pulse rate beats min in females vo max ml kg min pulse rate beats min statistical analyses were performed using spss statistics version descriptive statistics were used to evaluate the characteristics of each participant as frequency of categorical and statistics of numeric variables analysis of variance anova and correlation analysis

having lowest vo max to th quartile with highest vo max body composition measured by bmi bf vf and wc had an inverse relationship with vo max being high in those with lowest vo max quartile and low in those with highest vo max quartile this was further clarified by doing bmi stratification in each quartile it was observed that in both sexes overweight and obese dominated the first two quartiles while majority of subjects in last two quartiles were of normal weight discussion the present study was conducted to estimate the crf in young adults in males the aerobic fitness was significantly higher than females p normally the vo max in males is higher than in females in our study the difference was approx this is in part due to the higher fat content in females resulting in lower page of cardiorespiratory fitness and its association with adiposity indices in young adults lean muscle mass moreover males have a greater oxygen carrying capacity due to their higher hemoglobin content

lower performance in females seen in our study may also reflect a more sedentary lifestyle this can be attributed to social norms and limited access to exercise facility for females our findings are in agreement with other studies that have examined levels of crf in college going young adults table iii nabi et al assessed crf in year old medical students and observed vo max that was comparable to ours especially in females the low vo max obtained may be due to reduced physical activity and unhealthy lifestyle behaviors yadav et al measured crf in first year mbbs students the fitness levels observed were closer to our study however they used harvard step test protocol and the physical activity was performed for min a low crf in young adulthood is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality due to coronary artery disease later on in middle age the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia study conducted in us involved subjects aged years among other variables crf was assessed in all and the participants were followed for approx years it was observed that those with low crf later on developed cardiovascular risk factors in healthy men adiposity and age negatively affect vo max this was demonstrated by our study where overweight and obese of both sexes had low vo max while the majority of normal weight subjects had higher fitness levels one of the reason may be the higher lean muscle mass in subjects with lower body fat thus increasing exercise performance other studies have also demonstrated an increased crf in lean individuals as compared to their obese counterparts regarding body composition measured by bmi two important observations were made firstly our sample consisted of underweight females having a bmi kg m however their exercise capacity was better than the normal weight females secondly we observed that a considerable portion of students were either overweight or obese males and females having a bmi kg m reflecting the prevalence of a major risk factor for ncds at this young age while analyzing this regional data it must also be considered that the upper limits of normal bmi are kg m lower for asian population whereas the lower limits are considered the same as compared to caucasians i e kg m a revision may be needed in this regard to reconsider the lower limits of bmi based upon the local population as well as gender this study is the first to measure crf adiposity and gender correlations in pakistan and hence provides a base for future research however our sample was limited to only one medical college secondly the queens college step page of cardiorespiratory fitness and its association with adiposity indices in young adults test has its limitation of accuracy in measuring crf although it provides the best estimate in context of simplicity and cost future studies on crf involving larger number of participants of various age groups needs to be done focusing on risk factors of cardiovascular disease conclusion the present study reports a low level of overall crf in females furthermore there is a strong inverse relationship between crf and adiposity in both genders since college age students are shaping their adult behaviors the health change adopted during this period could increase crf decreasing the risk of chronic ncd in later years declaration of interest the

significantly with increasing vessel involvement conclusion increasing concentrations of serum icam can be used as a biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis alleviating the need to employ invasive tests like coronary angiography to confirm the diagnosis keywords atherosclerosis coronary angiography intracellular adhesion molecules introduction ischemic heart disease ihd is a generic description of a group related cardiac events resulting from hypoperfusion of the myocardium this hypoperfusion is a result of imbalance between oxygen delivery and myocardial metabolic demand the resultant symptom complex of ihd is to a lesser extent triggered by increased myocardial metabolic demand and attributed in majority of cases to reduction of coronary blood flow resulting from atherosclerotic process of coronary arteries leading to their obstruction due to this analogy ihd is also frequently referred to as coronary artery disease in spite of the monumental advances in ihd management over the last few decades it still remains the leading cause of death the symptomatology of ihd is a direct representative of coronary hypoperfusion the understanding of the complex mechanics of evolution of plaque its progression the factors involved in the page of serum intercellular adhesion molecule as a diagnostic biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis progression of plaque at molecular level is of prime importance in understanding the disease so as to discover newer methods of detection of the disease in its earlier stages the goal of modern medicine is to detect this disease in its initial stages to prevent its natural course focus has now shifted from radiological diagnosis to a molecular one as imaging provides evidence of the disease only when it is fairly advanced research into molecular level showing tell tale signs of coronary atherosclerosis with the help of adhesion molecules may represent a new frontier in the diagnosis and hence management and eventually prevention of such a prevalent disease cellular adhesion molecules like iutracellular adhesion molecule icam and vascular cell adhesion molecules vcam can be considered potential markers of vulnerability because such molecules are activated by inflammatory cytokines and chemokines and then released by the endothelium at present these adhesion molecules are the sole available markers for assessing endothelial activation and vascular inflammation also icam levels showed a positive correlation with atherosclerosis disease burden icam is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily i e the superfamily of proteins including antibodies and t cell receptors icam is known for its role in stabilizing cell cell interactions and facilitating leukocyte endothelial transmigration this study was done to compare serum concentration of adhesion molecules i e icam in patients with coronary atherosclerosis as compared to controls material and methods after approval by hospital ethical committee the research was

individuals serum discussion coronary artery disease cad is a major health issue in the world the incidence of cad among the population of southern pakistan is cad is characterized by a chronic inflammatory disease of the arterial wall leading eventually to atherosclerosis multiple pro inflammatory cytokines are involved in the pathogenesis of cad inflammation is the main event in the pathogenesis of atherosclerotic plaque formation and progression and inflammatory markers could be useful for atherosclerosis risk prediction and stratification serum icam levels were found to be significantly raised in patients having coronary artery disease as compared to normal individuals p value less than table in cases patients had single vessel had two vessel and had three vessel disease serum icam levels were seen to rise significantly with increasing number of coronary vessels affected with p value less than table the preliminary step in formation of atherosclerotic patch is leukocyte adhesion to the endothelial cell of the vessel wall followed by and transendothelial migration which leads to leucocyte aggregation the above mentioned process is in part mediated by cellular adhesion molecules cams which attach to the endothelial cell membrane in response to activation by various inflammatory cytokines like interleukin tumor necrosis factor and interferon pathological examination has shown a many fold increase of cam expression in atherosclerotic plaque which is backed by clinical data which reveals the role of adhesion molecule in coronary artery disease in terms of a promoter and a possible marker for this potentially reversible phenomenon the debate has originated for using icam and svcam as biomarkers of coronary atherosclerosis but also as

sd coronary atherosclerosis causes release of inflammatory cytokines which in turn generate increased expression of cams like soluble icam and svcam the mentioned cellular adhesion molecules play a crucial role in the migration of leucocytes from the blood to the arterial intima transendothelial route beginning as early as hours after an acute event of coronary blockage increasing titres of circulating serum adhesion molecules i e icam svcam and soluble endothelial selectin e selection can be detected and may be raised up to six months after the initial ischaemic event the observations about role of adhesion molecules has also been verified indirectly by cokerill et al who demonstrated in cultured endothelial cells that high density lipoprotein can inhibit cytokine induced expression of endothelial vcam icam and e selectin further to augment this statement a fall in serum levels of circulating adhesion molecule levels was seen when lipid apheresis was achieved in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia similar inferences were drawn by zhang et al who showed that lipid lowering diets and drugs decreased the levels of circulating sicam and svcam gross et al in a prospective study of individuals found a significant association between serum icam concentration and presence of both coronary artery calcification progression and carotid artery stenosis precursor page of serum intercellular adhesion molecule as a diagnostic biomarker of coronary atherosclerosis of atherosclerosis however no significant association was found on interaction between serum icam and c reactive protein crp on coronary artery calcification progression or carotid artery stenosis this study was part of the young adult longitudinal study of antioxidants yalta an ancillary study to coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia rhode et al in randomized double blind cross sectional study reviewed males with no previous history of myocardial infarction but having positive history of factors contributiong to coronary disease i e smoking hypertension alcohol consumption and raised serum triglycerides serum icam was found to be significantly raised in individuals with the above mentioned risk factors all of which are positively related to development of coronary atherosclerosis apart from the risk factors icam also had a positive correlation with fibrinogen tissue type plasminogen activator antigen and total homocysteine which are hallmarks of chronic inflammation a cross sectional study conducted by idrus in patients found that both serum icam and serum vcam levels were significantly raised in patients of coronary heart disease furthermore serum icam and serum vcam levels were significantly higher in acute cases as compared to chronic heart disease patients the author concluded that icam levels can be used as predictor of an acute coronary event sokei et al in a cross sectional study inferred that serum sicam concentration ng ml on admission was higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction unstable angina and stable angina the authors have suggested that with these findings cutoff values can be determined to diagnose acute coronary event decide about interventional procedures and even to stop medication on reversal of levels of circulating adhesion molecules jin et al in a cross sectional study employed patients deduced that serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule are raised in cases of coronary atherosclerosis and diabetes mellitus hung et al followed patients over months in which patients in various stages of coronary artery disease were followed and serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were highest in cases of acute coronary event and lowest but still raised in cases of chronic coronary atherosclerosis serum levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule were also used by the authors as predictors of future acute coronary events in high risk cases the most important aspect of scams seems to be the ability to predict future coronary events in terms of high risk patients and also to determine the need of invasive coronary procedures with fine tuning of the results high risk cases and those with strong family history can undergo invasive test provided they have raised serum icam conclusion increasing concentrations of serum icam can be used as a

the start of the trial the participants who had a higher score on the john henryism scale for active coping a strategy used to measure effortful coping were likely to find it hard to manage whatever life throws at them and were less potential to handle barriers to success the researchers also used the cook medley scale to evaluate hostility and suspicious attitudes towards others post two years the investigators used the mirror tracing star test to measure the cognitive ability of the study subjects when the participants turned year old they underwent the rey auditory verbal learning test ravlt for memory the digit symbol substitution test dsst for psychomotor speed and the modified stroop test for executive function the study found that the participants who had highest effortful

smoking marijuana for many years but now a new study suggests that pot may actually have a negative impact on health a study published in the journal of the american medical association s internal medicine division section suggests that smoking pot for years could impact verbal memory making it more difficult to remember some words while speaking leaf jpgcardia looked at marijuana use after yearsaccording to an article from livescience researchers said that about half of marijuana smokers experienced a reduction in their ability to remember words they said for every five years users had smoked pot half of them recalled one word fewer out of a word list however researchers did not see any negative impacts on other cognitive function measures like the abilities to plan or focus executive functions or users processing speed said the study the coronary artery risk development in young adults study went on for many years and included results from more than enrollees who were aged to participants reported on their follow up visits whether or not they had smoked marijuana in the month before after years researchers then gave them some cognitive tests to examine processing speed executive functions and verbal memory they only did the tests after the year mark verbal memory worsens with more years of marijuana smokingthe researchers associated long term use of marijuana worth worse performance in all three of their tests after adjusting for a number of other factors like depression and using other drugs or alcohol however the only statistically significant link out of the three was the one associating a negative impact on verbal memory with long term marijuana use as a result they think the links between pot and the other two cognitive functions might have happened only because of chance they also found independently that that the more marijuana someone smoked over a longer period of time the worse their verbal memory got in middle age they re not exactly sure just how exposure to the drug impacts verbal memory although one suggestion they offer is that tetrahydrocannabinol better known as thc which causes most of the psychological effects of

adverse events body healthday news new evidence based guidelines for cholesterol management to prevent atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease no longer recommend specific ldl cholesterol or non hdl targets and instead focus on tailoring statin therapy according to certain risk groups this guideline represents a departure from previous guidelines because it doesn t focus on specific target levels of ldl cholesterol instead it focuses on defining groups for whom ldl lowering is proven to be most beneficial neil j stone md chair of the expert panel that authored the guidelines said in a statement the expert panel composed of members of theamerican college of cardiology acc and american heart association aha in conjunction with thenational heart lung and blood institute nhlbi performed the first update to cholesterol management guidelines in nine years during a media conference stone and co chair donald m lloyd jones md scm both of northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in chicago emphasized the lack of evidence for treating to target but added that regularly measuring ldl cholesterol levels will remain a mainstay of treatment there have been no clinical trials in which they ve taken an approach where they ve titrated medication dosing to achieve a certain ldl level so we just couldn t endorse that kind of approach lloyd jones explained and yet we re not abandoning the measurement of ldl cholesterol because it s perhaps our best marker of understanding whether patients are going to achieve as much benefit as they can for the dose of statin they can tolerate for the clinician it s also a very important marker of adherence the main aim of the updated guidelines is to simplify treatment so clinicians don t have to worry about taking additional measures to lower ldl cholesterol if a patient has already been treated with an appropriate dose of statin therapy in secondary prevention what if your patient is on high intensity statin therapy and gets an ldl cholesterol level of mg dl and is adhering to an excellent lifestyle stone said from our point of view there is a large body of page of new cholesterol guidelines drop specific targets evidence that says he s actually doing as good a job as he can possibly do if he has to get to an optional goal of under mg dl as some would advocate it means adding on medicines for which there is not proven benefit instead the new recommendations assert that lifestyle modification before and in conjunction with cholesterol lowering drug therapies is crucial the task force identified four major primary and secondary prevention patient groups it determined should be treated with satins based on results from randomized controlled clinical trials that show treatment benefits outweigh the risks these include individuals with clinical atherosclerotic cvd individuals with ldl cholesterol levels mg dl such as those with familial hypercholesterolemia individuals aged to years with diabetes who have ldl cholesterol levels between to mg dl and without evidence of atherosclerotic cvd those without clinical atherosclerotic cvd who have ldl cholesterol levels of to mg dl and an estimated year risk of atherosclerotic cvd for patients with atherosclerotic cvd or with ldl cholesterol levels mg dl high intensity statin therapy such as with rosuvastatin crestor astrazeneca to mg or atorvastatin mg should be prescribed to reduce ldl cholesterol levels at least the guidelines state for patients with contraindications or statin associated adverse events a moderate intensity statin defined as a drug that lowers ldl cholesterol to should be used instead clinicians should choose a moderate intensity statin to treat patients aged to years with diabetes but opt for a high intensity statin if the patient also has a year risk of atherosclerotic cvd exceeding treatment with either a moderate or high intensity statin is recommended for individuals aged to years without cvd or diabetes but who has a year risk of clinical events and an ldl cholesterol level from to mg dl in addition to identifying and stratifying risk groups for statin therapy the expert panel developed a new global risk assessment tool to predict the future risk for cvd and stroke the model uses pooled cohort equations from the framingham heart study the atherosclerosis risk in communities study the coronary artery risk development in young adults and the cardiovascular health study however some healthcare providers have expressed concern about how the new atherosclerotic risk score will perform as it does not consider family history of future cvd triglyceride levels waist circumference bmi lifestyle habits or smoking history additional recommendations in the guidelines focus on safety and providing

who had blood pressure measured at study entry at a mean age of years and who completed a follow up questionnaire at a mean age of years at which time they reported physician diagnosed hypertension the participants were followed for mortality until the end of the study was limited by several factors including a lack of diversity in sex race social class and lifestyle as well as by a low smoking prevalence which may explain the fewer cardiovascular deaths compared with u s mortality statistics page of hypertension early drove up mortality risk later this study was supported by a wellcome trust fellowship and by the u s national institutes of health the authors reported that they have no relevant disclosures view on the news blood pressure matters at every age despite the limitations of this study by dr gray and associates the primary hypothesis that blood pressure matters in young adulthood is likely correct particularly when considered in the context of prior studies indeed taken together the available data including their own analysis of the cardia coronary artery risk development in young adults study help bolster the inference that blood pressure early in life can cause vascular damage that results in related mortality later in life the clinical implications of this inference are potentially profound younger adults with hypertension tend to remain unaware of their hypertension and are less likely to be on treatment and less likely to have their blood pressure controlled thanks to rising obesity rates and challenges within the health care system the problem will likely worsen the findings of this study pose new challenges for those working in health care researchers must address the difficult evidence gap in the lack of randomized controlled trials of blood pressure treatment in young adults and the most effective and efficient approach for generating and evaluating evidence of treatment effect on long term outcomes in this population clinicians and public health practitioners must address the growing need to emphasize and support lifestyle approaches to the prevention and control of hypertension including a healthy diet and

including visceral obesity hypertension hypertriglyceridemia low high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c level and impaired glucose tolerance igt igt is an important intermediate step in the natural course of type diabetes mellitus dm patients with igt have higher risk for type dm and development of cardiovascular disease cvd therefore they constitute an important target group in primary prevention it is known that there is a relation between serum uric acid levels and cardiovascular page of relationship between uric acid levels and impaired glucose tolerance in subjects with metabolic syndrome conditions including hypertension mets coronary artery disease cerebrovascular disease vascular dementia preeclampsia and kidney disease increasing evidence suggests that uric acid may play a role in the mets and therefore some authors have provided evidence for including elevated serum uric acid with impaired renal clearance as a component of mets in this study the relationship between biochemical indices and uric acid levels were studied in a group of cases having high risk of developing type dm methodology eighty three patients with mets admitted to the diabetes outpatient

cardiovascular and ischemic heart disease both in men and women in the year prospective study by kekalainen et al it was found that while dyslipidemia hypertension and uric acid levels were associated with insulin resistance hypertension and very low density lipoprotein cholesterol were associated with impaired first phase insulin secretion in insulin resistant patients plasma uric acid

triglyceride had a significant independent association with uric acid levels obesity is one of the most important factors associated with mets and type dm rising in recent years in studies conducted with adults it was found that increased bmi is associated with hyperuricemia leptin is produced at adipocytes and it is one of the hormones that plays a key role in controlling body mass increased leptin levels are associated with insulin resistance in early type dm and mets bedir a et al demonstrated that leptin has a role in the relationship between obesity and hyperuricemia in addition hypertriglyceridemia and free fat acids were found to be associated with hyperuricemia independent from central body fat deposition and obesity in this study significant relationship between uric acid levels and waist circumference and bmi was observed while there was no relationship with triglyceride level the fact that uric acid was found to be associated with waist circumference and bmi in our study supports the information that uric acid is strongly assoc ated with obesity especially with abdominal obesity in conclusion in mets subjects with obesity and igt evaluation and treatment of uric

with a different snp genotype lost five times as much weight on the ornish diet mindy dopler nelson ph d of stanford calif university said at a conference sponsored by the american heart association in the original a to z study women were randomized to one of four popular diets ranging on a continuum from low carbohydrate to low fat they were the atkins diet the zone diet the learn diet and the ornish diet on average the women lost weight on all four diets the only significant difference was that they tended to lose somewhat more weight on the atkins diet than on the ornish diet jama within each of the diet groups there are women who had lost over kg as well as people who gained kg dr nelson said in an interview when you look at the averages you don t see the differences but when you look at each individual participant you see some variability some time after the conclusion of that trial a company called interleukin genetics approached stanford researchers and suggested they use the company s proprietary snp test to assess responders and nonresponders to particular diets in previous studies the company had found polymorphisms in three genes fatty acid binding protein ppar gamma and the beta adrenergic receptor that appeared to predict a person s response to diets among the women from the original study who agreed to provide dna samples from swabs of the inner cheek had

blood pressure or levels of cholesterol insulin and glucose the company s test showed that of the women had genotypes designated as low carb appropriate and had genotypes designated as low fat appropriate the interaction between genotype and diet was statistically significant with striking differences among the women in the lowest carb and lowest fat diets among the women on the atkins diet those designated as low carb appropriate lost an average of just under kg during months while those designated as low carb inappropriate lost about kg among the women on the ornish diet those designated as low fat appropriate lost an average of more than kg during months while those designated as low fat inappropriate lost an average of about kg page of genotype may help predict best diet response thus in each of those groups women who had been randomized to what was designated as the appropriate diet lost about five times as much weight as those randomized to the apparently inappropriate diet among women on the zone or learn diets which involve intermediate levels of carbohydrates and fat women with low carb and low fat genotypes did not have statistically significant differences in weight loss dr nelson acknowledged that the trial was relatively small and that the findings need to be confirmed in a larger trial in a more heterogeneous population nevertheless the

calcification than other women in men however the association with coronary artery calcification is statistically significant only for those who live in neighborhoods characterized both by economic deprivation and lack of social cohesion neighborhood deprivation and low cohesion may predict very early coronary heart disease in younger asymptomatic adults dr daniel kim said at a conference sponsored by the american heart association these results are consistent with neighborhood deprivation and low cohesion as fundamental or root causes of coronary heart disease women in the highest quartile of neighborhood deprivation had about a fold risk of coronary artery calcification cac compared with women in the lowest quartile similarly women in the lowest quartile of neighborhood cohesion had about twice the risk of cac as women in the highest quartile dr kim reported neither neighborhood cohesion nor neighborhood deprivation alone was significantly associated with cac in men but those living in the lowest three quartiles of neighborhood cohesion who were also living in deprived neighborhoods were about three times as likely to have cac as those living in deprived neighborhoods with the highest levels of cohesion data from the study came from adults participating in the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia study said dr kim of the harvard school of public health boston cardia is a prospective cohort study of young adults in four urban areas birmingham ala chicago minneapolis and oakland calif who have been followed since included in this study were those participants who had undergone measures of cac in when they were years old the investigators assessed neighborhood deprivation by combining six indicators median household income median value of housing units percentage of households receiving interest dividend or rental income percentage of adults who had completed high school percentage of adults who had completed college and percentage employed in executive managerial or specialty occupations they assessed perceived neighborhood cohesion from participants answers to five survey items people s willingness to help their neighbors whether the neighborhood is close knit whether people in the neighborhood can be trusted whether they get along with each other and whether they share the same values investigators adjusted their results page of neighborhood factors may predict cardiac risks my take access to high quality food is key dr kim s study is important because we don t pay enough attention to neighborhoods and their role in encouraging or discouraging good dietary practices it s well known that economically deprived neighborhoods tend to have lots of fast food emporia and not much in the way of first class supermarkets i m reminded that back in the s two great congressmen sen lister hill d ala and sen harold burton r ohio were successful in passing the landmark hospital survey and construction act this financed the construction and renovation of more than medical facilities many of which were in low income communities the modern version of the law would be an act by congress to finance the construction of first class supermarkets in more communities these supermarkets could stock high quality food and make it available at low prices this would allow people living in deprived communities

of professional football payers and by implication other very large athletes is similar to that of the general population according to a cross sectional study funded by the national football league it appears that high levels of physical activity offset the harmful cardiovascular effects of a body size large enough to fit the criteria for obesity said dr andrew m tucker of union memorial hospital baltimore and his associates body mass index has increased significantly among offensive and defensive linemen during the past years that taken together with sporadic premature deaths among these athletes has raised concern that football players and other large athletes may be at increased cardiovascular risk dr tucker and his colleagues assessed active veteran players on of the nfl teams using a device that measured body composition rather than bmi reliance on bmi alone as a size indicator for cvd risk may not be appropriate in nfl players because bmi does not take into account lean

prompted an nfl wide investigation to determine the underlying cause of players increased blood pressure the researchers said there was an array of limitations to the study the authors noted the

secondary drug prevention in routine primary care varies by sex age and socioeconomic circumstances the results were disappointing the rate of secondary prevention for all patients was surprisingly low only a quarter of men and a fifth of women received treatment following their stroke older patients were less likely to receive treatment but receipt of secondary prevention did not vary according to socio economic circumstance or sex on average mortality within the first year was per cent for patients receiving treatment compared with per cent for those not receiving treatment we need to be aware of our stroke patients medication when they are first discharged to ensure they have been given optimal medication for secondary prevention of stroke higher rate of hypertension in ex prisoners arch intern med the coronary artery risk development in young adults study examined the association between prior imprisonment and incident hypertension diabetes and dyslipidemia in patients under years old this was a longitudinal study of more than young adults who were followed up at intervals for up to years the results showed that incident hypertension was more common among previously imprisoned participants per cent versus per cent of those not incarcerated this association was independent of age gender race and drug and alcohol use page of journals watch those who were black and least educated had the strongest association between prior imprisonment and hypertension interestingly this was the subgroup most likely to be lost to follow up former inmates were also more likely than others to report having no regular source of medical care and also lack of treatment for hypertension at the seven year follow up and at all subsequent follow up examinations it may be that cardiovascular risk factors are assessed and treated more aggressively in those with a previous prison sentence statins are very effective at reducing risk of stroke lancet neurology although there are many studies demonstrating the effectiveness of statins for the prevention of coronary heart disease there are few regarding the effectiveness of statins in lowering stroke risk this french meta analysis of the use of statins for secondary prevention of stroke is therefore very interesting although there were only studies used in the analysis their results showed that for every mmol l reduction in ldl cholesterol there was a relative risk reduction of stroke of an impressive per cent even in secondary prevention of non cardioembolic stroke intense reduction of ldl cholesterol by statins significantly reduced the risk of recurrent stroke there was no evidence that statin use increased the risk of haemorrhagic stroke except in patients with prior haemorrhage statins are still only considered for prevention of atherothrombotic events postnatal depression and post traumatic stress bjog postnatal depression is very common and unfortunately is still underdiagnosed and undertreated there are many risk factors for postnatal depression including previous history of depression low social support and obstetric complications this swedish prospective longitudinal study was performed to find risk factors in pregnancy for both post traumatic stress and depression one month after childbirth the relationship between post traumatic stress and depression was also explored in this study only per cent of women had post traumatic stress and per cent had depression these two conditions were positively related the main predictive risk factors for both conditions were depression in early pregnancy and severe fear of childbirth the authors suggest that risk factors for post traumatic stress and depression after childbirth should be assessed ideally in early pregnancy migraine in recurrent depression br j psychiatry there is a clear established association between depression and headache however an association with migraine is still unclear this uk study compared patients with recurrent depression with psychiatrically healthy controls to investigate headache defined according to international headache society criteria page of journals watch unsurprisingly there was a higher rate of all headache types in the depression group compared with controls however the strongest association was between depression and migraine with aura among participants with recurrent headaches migraine with aura was significantly associated with depression the authors conclude that the association is likely to be explained by overlapping aetiological risk factors dr newson is a gp in the west midlands and a member of our team who regularly review the journals the quick study stroke secondary prevention is suboptimal especially in the elderly

salt intake an increase in bp from low to high salt diet is common and associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality even among normotensive individuals yet the pathophysiology of ssbp is not well understood the prevailing paradigm is that abnormalities of neurohormones that regulate sodium na retention and excretion and or na transporting pathways create na

framework emphasizes vascular dysregulation as the inciting mechanism in both constructs how na itself influences bp remains incompletely understood our preliminary work suggests that excess na induces a pro inflammatory state that sustains higher bp interleukin il drives the induction of interleukin il secreting t helper cells that were recently demonstrated to be pathogenic in response to na exposure il il and related cytokines regulate renal na transporters and raise bp through vascular inflammation fibrosis and impaired vasodilation the immune response to high and low salt diet in

than million are considered overweight if weight gain continues at its present rate of americans are estimated to be obese in overweight and obesity is a major public health concern because excess body fat leads to a higher risk for premature death and for many chronic diseases and conditions including type diabetes cardiovascular disease hypertension stroke insulin resistance syndrome gout osteoarthritis and some cancers e g colon endometrial postmenopausal breast the total health care costs attributed to obesity related diseases in were estimated at billion as a result federal government and state agencies the food and beverage industry and health professional organizations are desperately seeking ways to reduce the nation s obesity epidemic dairy doesn t make you fat experts generally agree that excess energy intake and reduced energy expenditure through less physical activity is responsible for the rise in obesity in the united states changes in the environment and in individual behavior that tend to encourage over consumption of calories and discourage physical activity are driving forces that account for the increased rate of obesity such as increased availability of energy dense nutrient poor foods and beverages increased portion sizes and increased consumption of meals outside the home misperceptions about foods and beverages can influence food choices leading to an increase in high calorie nutrient poor diets for example many individuals who are trying to lose weight eliminate or reduce their intake of dairy foods due to fears about weight gain and misperceptions that milk and other dairy foods are fattening in a recent survey of respondents indicated that they do not consume dairy foods regularly because they are trying to lose weight yet numerous studies indicate that recommended intakes of dairy foods are not linked to being overweight or obese in fact it has been shown that increased dairy consumption is linked with lower weight and body fat the recent dietary guidelines advisory committee report concluded that there is no evidence that consuming the recommended three servings of milk products a day increases body weight linking weight management with dairy foods the evidence page of understanding the role of dairy foods in weight management a growing body of research has demonstrated that dairy products can help achieve a healthy weight one of the earliest hints that dairy might affect body weight came from a clinical trial studying calcium s effect on lowering blood pressure in obese african american men with low calcium intakes the researchers found that increasing low calcium intake to mg day by eating two cups of yogurt day without reducing calories for one year unexpectedly reduced body fat by almost lbs since then numerous but not all studies in humans and animal models have demonstrated enhanced weight and or body fat loss when consuming a calorie reduced diet containing dairy foods calcium in recommended amounts observational evidence support for dairy foods beneficial role in weight management comes from several observational studies that evaluated the link between calcium dairy intake and body weight one such study the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia followed adults for years among overweight and obese adults the obesity occurrence and weight gain risk over years was lower in those consuming the most dairy foods versus those consuming the least neither the type of dairy product nor its fat content affected the study results the quebec family study of nearly adults reported that women who consumed less than mg calcium per day had greater body weight and body fat than women who consumed more than mg calcium per day a similar pattern was observed for body fat in men most studies in children and adolescents have also shown either inverse or neutral associations between calcium dairy foods and body weight and fat to date the majority of observational and clinical studies support a beneficial relationship between dairy food intake and lower body weight and body fat the failure of some studies to support this association may be explained by factors such as high baseline calcium intakes lack of control of energy intakes and or use of normal weight subjects clinical evidence the first clinical study directly demonstrating that increasing calcium intake from low to recommended levels through dairy foods can accelerate body weight and fat loss was conducted by researchers at the university of tennessee thirty two obese adults were assigned to one of three reduced calorie diets kcal day below maintenance needs a low calcium control diet rag day containing little or no dairy a diet adequate in calcium provided by calcium supplements rag day and a diet adequate in calcium provided by servings of milk cheese or yogurt rag day after weeks subjects lost and lbs of body weight in the control calcium supplement and dairy diet group respectively similar significance was observed for body fat loss with the greatest loss occurring in subjects on the dairy diet these results provided the first direct human evidence indicating that increasing dietary calcium intake from low levels to recommended levels of intake can accelerate body weight and body fat loss in obese subjects when consuming a diet moderately reduced in calories most important for the dairy industry the intake of dairy foods had a substantially greater effect on both weight and fat loss compared to an equivalent amount of supplemental calcium these findings have been confirmed by the tennessee researchers in two subsequent studies i e a week study in obese african americans and a week study using yogurt as the sole dairy food these studies also discovered that subjects on high dairy diets lost significantly less lean body mass than those on low dairy calcium diets suggesting a favorable preservation of muscle during weight loss three conditions common to these studies that may be important for demonstrating the favorable effects of adequate dairy calcium rag day on body weight and fat loss include a low baseline calcium intake of mg day overweight and obese subjects and moderate caloric restriction kcals day additional research is needed to verify the importance of these factors for dairy foods to accelerate weight fat loss how does it work studies in human fat cells and experimental animals have suggested possible mechanisms whereby calcium dairy food intake may modulate energy and fat metabolism briefly low calcium diets have been shown to increase the calcium regulating hormones calcitriol the active form of vitamin d and parathyroid hormone which increases calcium levels in fat cells research suggests that intracellular calcium plays an important role in regulating fat metabolism by increasing fat storage and inhibiting fat breakdown in fat cells conversely a high calcium diet inhibits the calcium regulating hormones thereby decreasing intracellular calcium which in turn decreases fat accumulation and increases the release of fat from fat cells page of understanding the role of dairy foods in weight management a growing body of research has demonstrated that dairy products can help achieve a healthy weight preliminary data from a recent human study that evaluated caloric expenditure in people given an adequate calcium diet provided by dairy foods has demonstrated significantly greater hour fat oxidation compared to a low calcium diet other mechanisms that also may play a rote in reducing body weight and fat include greater fecal fat loss with higher calcium diets and or decreased food intake via satiety effects induced by dairy bioactive peptides clearly additional research is needed in these areas to elucidate the mechanism s by which high calcium dairy food diets exert their effects on body composition a body of science is rapidly emerging that supports a relationship between dairy food calcium consumption and effects on body weight and fat clinical research in overweight and obese adults has found greater weight and fat loss with consumption of three servings of milk cheese or yogurt daily as part of a moderately reduced calorie diet and adequate in calcium versus a reduced calorie diet with little or no dairy the types of dairy foods consumed in these clinical trials included full fat reduced fat low fat and fat free milk cheese or yogurt products as subjects were allowed choice within the reduced caloric goals summary
