    "YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Yake! does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: My understanding is that YAKE! is meant to be run on a **single document as a string**. If you have multiple documents, you need to merge them into one single string before using YAKE!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! features to note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus-Independent:** YAKE! offers a solution which can retrieve keywords from a single document only, without the need to rely on external document collection statistics as IDF does; i.e., it can be applied to any text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Domain and Language-Independent:** YAKE! works with domains and languages for which there are no ready keyword extraction systems, as it neither requires a training corpus nor depends on sophisticated external sources (such as WordNet or Wikipedia) or linguistic tools (such as NER or PoS taggers) other than a static list of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interior Stopwords:** YAKE! can retrieve keywords containing interior stopwords (e.g., “game of Thrones”) with higher precision than the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale:** YAKE! scales to any document length linearly in the number of candidate terms identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency-free:** meaning that no conditions are set with respect to the minimum frequency or sentence frequency that a candidate keyword must have. Therefore, based on the features used, a keyword may be considered significant or insignificant with either one occurrence or with multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! has five main steps:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text pre-processing and candidate term identification.** The first step pre-processes the document into a machine-readable format in order to identify potential candidate terms.This is an important and crucial step to identify better candidate terms and thus to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction.** The second phase takes as input a list of individual terms and represents them by a set of statistical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing term score.** In the third step, these features are heuristically combined into a single score likely to reflect the importance of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **n-gram generation and computing candidate keyword score.** The fourth step then generates the candidate keywords (through an n-gram7 construction methodology) and assigns them scores, based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data deduplication and ranking.** Finally, the fifth step compares likely similar keywords through the application of a deduplication distance similarity measure. The list of final keywords is then sorted by their relevance scores. \n",
    "\n",
