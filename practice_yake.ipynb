    "YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Yake! does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE: My understanding is that YAKE! is meant to be run on a **single document as a string**. If you have multiple documents, you need to merge them into one single string before using YAKE! In other terms, YAKE! does not seem to take in a list of strings (strings separated by a comma) or a list of lists. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! features to note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Corpus-Independent:** YAKE! offers a solution which can retrieve keywords from a single document only, without the need to rely on external document collection statistics as IDF does; i.e., it can be applied to any text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Domain and Language-Independent:** YAKE! works with domains and languages for which there are no ready keyword extraction systems, as it neither requires a training corpus nor depends on sophisticated external sources (such as WordNet or Wikipedia) or linguistic tools (such as NER or PoS taggers) other than a static list of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Interior Stopwords:** YAKE! can retrieve keywords containing interior stopwords (e.g., “game of Thrones”) with higher precision than the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale:** YAKE! scales to any document length linearly in the number of candidate terms identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Term Frequency-free:** meaning that no conditions are set with respect to the minimum frequency or sentence frequency that a candidate keyword must have. Therefore, based on the features used, a keyword may be considered significant or insignificant with either one occurrence or with multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **YAKE! has five main steps:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Text pre-processing and candidate term identification.** The first step pre-processes the document into a machine-readable format in order to identify potential candidate terms.This is an important and crucial step to identify better candidate terms and thus to improve the effectiveness of the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature extraction.** The second phase takes as input a list of individual terms and represents them by a set of statistical features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing term score.** In the third step, these features are heuristically combined into a single score likely to reflect the importance of the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **n-gram generation and computing candidate keyword score.** The fourth step then generates the candidate keywords (through an n-gram7 construction methodology) and assigns them scores, based on their importance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Data deduplication and ranking.** Finally, the fifth step compares likely similar keywords through the application of a deduplication distance similarity measure. The list of final keywords is then sorted by their relevance scores. \n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",

introduction cardiovascular disease cvd is the leading cause of death worldwide and in brazil leading to increased morbidity and disability adjusted life year daly . despite the decrease in mortality rates and daly standardized by age in brazil possibly as a result of successful health policies their total number is increasing mainly due to aging and illnesses in the population.1 classical risk factors hypertension dyslipidemia obesity sedentary lifestyle smoking diabetes and family history raise the pre test probability of cvd particularly of coronary artery disease cad and determine primary and secondary prevention. several other factors including sociodemographic ethnic cultural dietary and behavioral aspects can also explain the differences in cvd burden among populations and their trends over the decades. the implementation of health policies among them encouraging healthy lifestyle habits and providing access to primary and secondary cvd prevention measures associated with the treatment of cardiovascular cv events are essential to control cvd in all countries including brazil. the i brazilian cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology sociedade brasileira de cardiologia sbc published in 2013 2 aimed at helping reduce cv mortality as established by the world health assembly in may 2012 sbc reaffirmed its commitment to decreasing the premature cvd mortality rate by 25 .3 however the reduction in cvd mortality has reached a plateau in the past five years in brazil with significant regional variation suggesting the need for renewing strategies to combat these diseases.4 with this purpose sbc revisited its cv prevention guideline 2 proposing to update themes related to the primary prevention of cvd and suggesting strategies that could assist brazilian cardiologists in reducing morbidity and mortality from these groups of causes. the brazilian cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 updates the strategies that address classical risk factors and discusses new concepts such as the need to gather knowledge about emerging risk factors for instance spirituality socioeconomic and environmental factors as well as additional strategies like the use of vaccines. we hope to contribute to renew the sbc commitment with the brazilian society and the strategic action plan for tackling chronic non communicable diseases ncd 5 of which cvd is the main component with an instrument that will allow systematized access to the current literature disseminating the knowledge necessary to resume the decreasing trend in cv mortality in brazil. 1. risk stratification 1.1. cardiovascular risk stratification to prevent and treat atherosclerosis the first manifestation of atherosclerotic disease in approximately half of the people who have this complication is an acute coronary event. therefore identifying asymptomatic individuals with higher predisposition is crucial for effective prevention associated with the correct definition of therapeutic targets. the so called risk scores and algorithms based on regression analysis of population studies were created to estimate the severity of cvd substantially enhancing the identification of overall risk. the framingham gloal risk score grs 6 included the estimate of 10 years of coronary and cerebrovascular events peripheral arterial disease or heart failure hf and was the score adopted by the department of atherosclerosis of sbc departamento de aterosclerose da sociedade brasileira de cardiologia sbc da .7 in addition individuals who have multiple risk factors for cv subclinical atherosclerosis or already had manifestations of cvd have a high risk for events and can be classified differently. thus the new cv risk stratification proposed by the sbc da defines four levels of cv risk very high risk high risk moderate risk low risk 795 updated updated cardiovascular prevention

risk individuals who have a significant atherosclerotic disease coronary cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular with or without clinical events belong to this category chart 1.1 . 1.3. high risk patients in primary prevention who present ors 20 men or 10 women or aggravating risk conditions based on clinical data or subclinical atherosclerosis chart 1.2 . 1.4. moderate risk the estimated risk for atherosclerotic disease results from the sum of the risk associated with each risk factor and the powering caused by synergisms between some of these factors. given the complexity of these interactions intuitive risk allocation often leads to under or overestimation of higher or lower risk cases respectively. among the algorithms created to stratify cv risk the last updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis prevention recommends the use of ors which estimates the risk for myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident cva hf fatal or non fatal or peripheral vascular insufficiency in 10 years. based on this score individuals with grs ranging from 5 to 20 males and 5 to 10 females are classified as moderate risk. patients with diabetes mellitus dm without sad criteria or rs are also considered at moderate risk. many middle aged individuals belong to this risk category chart 1.3 . part of the latest recommendations leans towards inflammatory conditions and the use of coronary calcium to restratify patients at moderate risk.8 1.5. low risk any estimated cv risk based on findings of observational studies inevitably has limitations related to calibration and discriminatory power the attempt to allocate a certain risk percentage to each patient collides with individual aspects not covered by risk prediction equations. the idea of restoring the concept of aggravating risk understood as individual phenotypic expressions causally related to greater chances of a cv outcome to improve somewhat the individualization of the algorithms created from large population samples has been gaining strength.8 however in the low risk population stratum an aggravating risk in those with less than 5 chance of having a cv outcome in 10 years6 8 would hardly have a decisive influence in this relatively short time interval. on the other hand as age is one of the most important determinants of risk for cv events a man aged 62 years without sad normotensive non smoker non diabetic and with optimal levels of serum lipids would already be classified by ors as moderate risk even without any aggravating factor.6 796 updated updated

considered at low cv risk are those aged 30 to 74 years of both genders whose risk for cv events calculated by grs is lower than 5 in 10 years6 7 chart 1.4 . although the calcium score is not recommended for low risk patients non diabetic individuals at moderate risk without a family history of premature coronary disease who have a zero calcium score can be considered at low risk and postpone the start of the cholesterol lowering therapy with statins.8 aggravating risk factors are not used in patients considered at low cv risk. the north american guideline of 2018 considers

factor for cad.11 genetic12 and clinical studies with statins and other lipid lowering drugs provide ample evidence that lower ldl c levels are associated with the proportional decrease in cv outcomes including myocardial infarction cva and cv death.13 14 the 2017 updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia incorporated some changes in the approach of dyslipidemias compared to the previous version.7 one of the changes was that fasting was no longer mandatory for total cholesterol tc and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c tests provided that the laboratory specifies the situation in the report without fasting or with 12 hour fasting. as for triglycerides tg it might increase in the absence of fasting. in hypertriglyceridemia particularly with a value 440 mg dl a new collection after 12 hour fasting is crucial.15 apolipoprotein apoa1 and apob levels can be determined in a sample without prior fasting and moderately high tg levels do not influence immunochemical methods. the analytical performance of this methodology is good and the levels can be measured in automated platforms with an immunoturbidimetry or nephelometry profile. there is evidence of an independent association between elevated lipoprotein a lp a and cvd risk in the general population 16 not only for the lipid content of lp a but also for its prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties. the gold standard for quantification of plasma concentrations is the measurement of apo a mass by turbidimetry nephelometry or chemiluminescence using isoform insensitive assays which figure 1.1 cardiovascular

for routine assessment of cvd risk in the general population but it should be determined in the risk stratification of individuals with a family history of premature atherosclerotic disease and familial hypercholesterolemia fh .7 lp a values above 50 mg dl equivalent to 80 are considered high if the result is in nmol l it should be multiplied by 2.5 with lp a values above 125 nmol l classified as high.7 table 2.1 reports the reference values of the lipid profile with and without fasting according to the evaluation of cv risk in adults. the primary ldl c and secondary non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c therapeutic targets for lipid control are established following the risk stratification of patients discussed in chapter 1 . this stratification considers the presence or absence of clinical or subclinical atherosclerotic disease the presence of diabetes and the grs with subsequent risk classification into four possible categories low 5 moderate 5 10 in women and 5 20 in men high 10 in women and 20 in men and very high clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 30 risk. chapter 1 presents the complete risk stratification. specific targets for each category were defined in accordance with table 2.1.7 the updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis prevention7 also included a change in cv risk stratification for individuals already using statins. considering the imprecision of risk calculation in these patients the guideline proposes using a correction factor for tc to estimate the risk score in this context derived from studies that compared the efficacy of different statins in the doses used and that allowed an average ldl c reduction of 30 with the treatment.17 this situation applies to most patients who take moderate doses of statins. given the average tc reduction of 30 with statins patients who use these medicines should have their tc multiplied by 1.43.17 moreover in the initial approach the target for individuals who are not on lipid lowering treatment should be decreasing the percentage of ldl c and non hdl c. for those already on lipid lowering therapy the recent guideline also established a reduction in absolute ldl c and non hdl c values with the treatment as shown in table 2.2. 2.1.1. familial hypercholesterolemia fh is a genetic condition characterized by very high ldl c levels and therefore increased risk for premature atherosclerotic disease especially of a coronary event. however despite its importance this condition is still underdiagnosed and undertreated.18 19 this version of the guideline reinforces that greatly increased cholesterol values could indicate fh after excluding secondary dyslipidemias. adult individuals with tc values 310 mg dl or children and adolescents with levels 230 mg dl should be evaluated for this possibility. among the clinical scores available for fh we highlight the dutch lipid clinic network score used in our field and presented in table 2.3. in addition to clinical scores the genetic test for fh is a very useful but not mandatory tool to confirm suspected cases and screen relatives of established index cases. 2.2.

hf compared to non diabetic individuals.34 as cad patients are excluded the incidence of hf in the diabetic population decreases but remains significantly higher than in non diabetic individuals. in type 1 diabetes above 7 each 1 increment in glycated hemoglobin hba1c was associated with a 30 increase in hf risk 35 while type 2 diabetes was associated with a 16 increase in the risk regardless of other risk factors including obesity smoking hypertension dyslipidemia and coronary disease.36 37 diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction initially asymptomatic and that progresses slowly to diastolic or systolic dysfunction followed by hf with clinical repercussion.38 occasionally diabetic cardiomyopathy can manifest as arrhythmias and sudden death. mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological process include mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation dysfunction in the mitochondrial ca2 management activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas and the sympathetic nervous system sns cardiac autonomic neuropathy endoplasmic reticulum stress microvascular dysfunction and disorders of cardiac energy metabolism.39 41 3.1.1. myocardial risk estimate despite the lack of an universally accepted method to estimate hf risk specifically in diabetic individuals methods such as plasma brain natriuretic peptide bnp echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction and risk calculators such as the health abc heart failure score and the framingham heart failure risk score are often used to estimate the future risk for symptomatic hf. elaborating a standardized strategy to screen and intervene in patients at hf risk might be difficult due to its different definitions the heterogeneity of its prevalence in various populations its inconstant duration until the development of clinic hf or left ventricular dysfunction and the varying interventions to modify or treat risk factors. as we shall see below the health abc heart failure score is the mechanism with the highest sensitivity and specificity and should be recommended as the primary strategy in risk stratification of symptomatic hf. nonetheless bnp can be used concomitantly to reclassify individuals at high risk for hf. the evidence that supports the use of bnp in diabetic patients to predict the hf risk is based on two randomized controlled trials. as shown in table 3.1 these programs recruited 1 674 patients without hf for randomization and identified a total of 29 subsequent events of hospitalization for hf. the combined statistical power of these studies is limited but provides the perspective for the potential benefit of screening based on biomarkers such as bnp. diastolic dysfunction on the echocardiogram historically experts disagree on recommendations for echocardiographic diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction as 804 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 shown in the 2009 guidelines of the american society of echocardiography and the european association of cardiovascular imaging ase eacvi and the canberra study criteria csc .44 45 based on these recommendations epidemiological studies and a meta analysis46 47 suggest that preclinical diastolic dysfunction stage b hf defined as diastolic dysfunction with normal systolic function and without hf symptoms is common in dm and that its presence increases by 61 to 70 the risk for developing symptomatic hf stages c and d . despite being simple and non invasive 46 47 the echocardiographic diagnosis for patients at higher risk for hf does not seem to be as cost effective as the measurement of bnp 48 49 although these data are not specifically available for the brazilian population. the diagnostic criteria became more specific and less sensitive in the 2016 ase eacvi guideline 50 51 despite the simplification. with these criteria the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in the general population ranges from 1 to 7 . however no studies have been designed to focus on primary prevention based on this diagnostic criterion. risk scores for future hf the hf risk in patients with dm and metabolic syndrome ms can be predicted with clinical scores. although no scores have been developed specifically for patients with dm or ms several studies have demonstrated good performance in these populations. among the most used scores are the i health abc heart failure score 52 the ii the framingham heart failure risk score 53 and the iii and the atherosclerosis risk in communities aric heart failure risk score.54 the variables included in the framingham heart failure risk score are age gender cad diabetes left ventricular hypertrophy based on electrocardiogram ecg valvular disease heart rate and systolic blood pressure sbp . the health abc heart failure score includes the framingham variables with the following differences addition of serum albumin serum creatinine and smoking replacement of glucose for diabetes and exclusion of valvular disease. the aric heart failure risk score includes age ethnicity gender cad diabetes sbp use of medicines for blood pressure bp heart rate smoking and body mass index bmi . designed for a community population of older adults the health abc heart failure score reached a positive and negative predictive power of 10 and 15 in comparison with the framingham heart failure risk score52 and 2 to 4 above the aric heart failure risk.54 the health abc heart failure score is an instrument validated in observational and intervention studies and thus considered a reference for estimating the future hf risk in patients with dm and ms detailed description in figure 3.1 . although all scores are designed with only the variables listed above the addition of bnp or nt probnp as linear variables would significantly increase the predictive power of all scores.52 54 based on the thresholds used in the studies pontiac43 and stop hf 42 we suggest reclassifying individuals with bnp 50 pg ml or nt probnp 125 pg ml into a higher risk category. 3.1.2. preventive therapies for individuals at high and very high risk for heart failure in 5 years and secondary prevention for those with clinical heart failure drug therapies for dm2 that impact hf as stated previously above 7 the hf risk increases by 8 for each 1 increment in hba1c while a 1 reduction decreases the risk by 16 . although several clinical trials have investigated the effect of metformin on the cv system based on the pathophysiology of insulin resistance the effect of this class directly on hf remains inconclusive. studies with insulin and sulfonylureas showed a neutral effect on hf and glucagon like peptide 1 glp 1 agonists analogs55 and acarbose56 proved to be neutral regarding the risk for hf hospitalizations and mortality. more recently three large studies empa reg canvas and declare revealed that sodium glucose 2 sglt2 cotransporter inhibitors reduced cv outcomes including hf hospitalizations.57 58 hf mortality among individuals who used empagliflozin was significantly lower than in those using a placebo. the studies empa reg and declare associated the risk of taking these drugs with a higher rate of genital infections in the group using empagliflozin and dapagliflozin while the canvas study showed an increased risk of lower limb amputation.57 58 together all three sglt2 inhibitors available empagliflozin canagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce the risk for hf hospitalization even in asymptomatic patients at the start of treatment. therefore the use of these drugs is recommended for patients with dm or ms at high or very high risk for hf. among the hypoglycemic agents that increase the chance of hf we highlight the thiazolidinediones record study rosiglitazone and proactive pioglitazone 59 60 and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor dpp 4i the saxagliptin savor timi 53 .61 in the studies record and savor timi patients with hf also had higher subsequent mortality rates. thus rosiglitazone pioglitazone and saxagliptin are contraindicated for patients with or at high risk for hf. 3.1.3. therapies focused on cardiac remodeling although only two clinical trials substantiate these recommendations patients with dm and ms at high and very high risk for hf seem to benefit from the early introduction of anti remodeling therapies such as raas inhibitors and beta blockers. based on these pharmacological strategies triggered by bnp or nt probnp levels above the risk threshold the studies pontiac43 and stop hf42 suggested reducing the risk for hf hospitalization and mortality. in patients with clinical hf clinical trials have demonstrated that the drug therapies tested were equally effective regardless of the presence of dm and ms. angiotensin blockers the charm trial candesartan 62 val heft valsartan 63 and atlas lisinopril 64 have demonstrated that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or aldosterone receptor blockers arb favored the decrease in mortality and hospitalization among patients who had hf and reduced ejection fraction regardless of the presence of dm2 or ms. 805 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 mineralocorticoid antagonists patients with and without dm2 showed a reduction in mortality with the use of both spironolactone rales trial 65 and eplerenone emphasis hf .66 we underline the risk for hyperkalemia which might particularly affect patients with renal function deterioration and already using acei or arb. beta blockers in patients with dm and hf the use of metoprolol succinate merit hf bisoprolol cibis ii and carvedilol copernicus is recommended. they presented equal efficiency in patients with and without dm. a meta analysis that included six trials indicated a reduction in all cause mortality among patients with dm2 as well as in non diabetic individuals.67 nitrates and hydralazine approximately 40 of the patients randomized in the a heft trial had dm2. in this subpopulation the combination of a fixed dose of hydralazine and nitrate significantly reduced all cause mortality.68 ivabradine its use decreased mortality and hospitalizations in patients with and without dm2 in the shift study which involved 6 558 patients.69 the sacubitril valsartan combination is not well established yet in patients with preserved ejection fraction or at high risk for hf even for patients with reduced ejection fraction there is no specific study or subanalysis focused on the diabetic population. 3.2. atherosclerotic risk 3.2.1. metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus and the continuous corollary of coronary artery disease ms and the dm comprise a spectrum of multisystemic diseases particularly in the vascular endothelium that contribute dramatically to the progression of pathophysiological substrates of cad. robust evidence suggests that cv risk increases even in stages that precede the clinical diagnosis of dm in 10 to 20 years based on current criteria. as ms is one of the main risk factors for dm considering it within a continuum of metabolic changes related to coronary atherothrombosis is reasonable.70 71 in fact estimates indicate that glucose metabolic changes precede the diagnosis of diabetes in 4 to 12 years72 figure 3.2 . while in early stages the overproduction of insulin can compensate its resistance after a certain point the pancreatic

adaptive to insulin resistance and cellular oxidative stress become irreversible. another mechanism that seems to occur even in early stages pre hyperglycemia is the accumulation of fatty acids in various tissues such as pancreas heart and liver accelerating the dysfunction in insulin production hepatic glucose production and left ventricular diastole.73 therefore even remotely before the period of hyperglycemia several cellular mechanisms cooperate to determine the endothelial dysfunction the phenotypic changes in lipids with hypertriglyceridemia and small dense ldl creating the ideal scenario for accelerated atherogenesis.74 together these data suggest that cad becomes accelerated many years before the onset of hyperglycemia. 3.2.2. primary prevention strategies for coronary artery disease in individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus corroborating the pathophysiological evidence weight control strategies with physical activity and intensive dietary guidance have proven to be the best available method to reduce the risk of a patient with ms and pre dm developing the clinical diagnosis of dm.75 76 lifestyle interventions decreased the risk for dm by 45 p 0.001 the risk for cv death by 41 p 0.033 and all cause mortality by 29 p 0.049 . in patients with established dm and microalbuminuria the randomized clinical trial steno 277 showed that a multifactorial approach to lifestyle significantly decreased cv morbidity and mortality in comparison with conventional treatment. 3.2.3. individual risk prediction for coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome at least 68 of diabetic patients aged 65 years or older die from heart diseases most of them from cad followed by congestive hf.78 dm is considered an independent cv risk factor both in men and women raising in about two to four times the probability of clinical cad when compared to individuals without dm.79 moreover based on a meta analysis with almost 1 million individuals from 87 studies ms is associated with a twofold increase in cv outcomes and a 1.5 increase in all cause mortality exceeding the isolated risk of its components.80 the cad risk in the population with dm or ms however is not evenly distributed. several strategies for cad screening were implemented in recent decades although figure 3.2 progression of

the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 most of them have proven to be fruitless as these groups are at high risk for cad. revascularization strategies guided by myocardial perfusion scintigraphy or coronary computed tomography angiography in asymptomatic diabetic individuals were not superior to clinical management based only on traditional risk factors. in the study factor 64 a randomized clinical trial with 900 patients with dm1 or dm2 for at least three years and without cad symptoms the revascularization strategy guided by coronary computed tomography angiography did not reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome acs or cv mortality.81 similarly in the studies diad82 and dynamit 83 the revascularization strategy guided by exercise stress test with scintigraphy did not improve cv and non cv outcomes compared to conventional medical treatment in 1 900 asymptomatic diabetic patients. currently the more efficient and practical resources to determine cv risk in diabetic patients have been the isolated control of its risk factors. subanalyses of the diabetes heart study84 and factor 6481 revealed that the factors with greater predictive power for acs risk were the use of statins and ldl c levels followed by glomerular filtration rate microalbuminuria and c reactive protein crp . the treatment of cv risk factors related to aggressive diabetes is the method more strongly associated with the reduction in cv morbidity and acs mortality in diabetic patients as demonstrated in the study steno 2.77 however as detailed below the most effective way of predicting risk and managing more or less intensive targets in primary prevention should be combining risk and coronary calcium scores. 3.2.4. risk calculator risk scores are among the most commonly used strategies consisting of estimating risk based on prospective data collected from cohorts of diabetic patients such as the ukpds the decode the darts the advance the swedish national diabetes register and the dcs.85 86 other calculators developed for mixed populations diabetics and non diabetics are also widely used ors sbc framingham pooled cohort equations ascvd reynolds score procam and others.74 the main advantage of these methods lies in their easy application in clinical practice as they consider the usual clinical data such as age laboratory test values and anthropometric information. the ukpds calculator is more recommended for diabetic patients idf21 guidelines nice canadian diabetes association australian national vascular disease prevention alliance and others and the ors is the more widely used in the brazilian diabetic and non diabetic population. nevertheless these and other strategies to estimate the progression of vascular diseases are still limited underestimating the risk in young patients with dm or recently diagnosed patients while overestimating the risk in individuals diagnosed for 10 years or with hba1c 9.0 .87 89 also the scores do not take into account the advances of the last 5 to 10 years such as new drugs and diagnostic methods and have relatively low predictive performance c statistic between 0.54 0.70 considering that 30 to 60 of individuals are at moderate risk.87 in this scenario adding the coronary calcium score to clinical risks has become the most efficient and cost effective alternative to estimate the cad risk in patients at moderate risk. 3.2.5. coronary artery calcium score coronary artery calcium cac is a highly specific characteristic of coronary atherosclerosis. the cac score cacs is an available consistent and reproducible method to evaluate the risk for future coronary events essentially by guiding primary prevention strategies.90 cacs in asymptomatic populations is cost effective for moderate risk patients90 and has a positive impact on adherence to treatment.91 the multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa developed a valuable and useful support tool for cacs to predict risk incorporating cacs to a clinical model using 10 year follow up data until the first manifestation of cad.92 the mesa score involves individuals aged 45 to 85 years providing cad risk in 10 years with and without cacs. the heinz nixdorf recall hnr and the dallas heart study validated the score.92 the greatest limitation of the mesa score is that its algorithm does not include all forms of atherosclerotic disease which differentiates it from the ors sbc.93 in an analysis of patients from the mesa study94 who had an estimate of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd of 5 to 7.5 in 10 years a cacs 0 was associated with an ascvd observed rate of 1.5 while any calcium score 0 was associated with an actual rate of events of at least 7.5 . in individuals from mesa with an ascvd risk between 7.5 and 20 a cacs 0 was associated with an event rate of around 4.5 while a cacs 0 was associated with a net benefit of statin therapy of approximately 10.5 . cacs should represent a way of segregating diabetic individuals with a higher atherosclerotic burden and possibly those suffering for longer the vascular effects of insulin resistance associated with endotheliopathy which begins in the early stages of pre diabetes.72 as explained above pathophysiologically vascular disease especially diabetic coronary disease starts long before its clinical diagnosis. however the strategies to map the progression of the vascular disease in earlier stages are still limited and there are few viable tools for clinical practice. thus a clinical score such as the ors sbc combined with cacs is the most efficient way to predict the cad risk in moderate risk patients. 3.2.6. lipid targets in primary prevention for individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus statins are among the most prescribed drugs worldwide reflecting their fundamental role in primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease and the high prevalence of dyslipidemias. several randomized clinical trials rct and meta analyses such as the cholesterol treatment trialists ctt collaboration 14 solidified the indication of statins. among 21 rct comparing statin and 808 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 placebo with a total of 129 526 individuals followed for 4.8 years each 40 mg dl reduced of ldl c decreased the incidence of cv events by 12 and cad deaths by 20 . moreover the ctt analyses showed that a greater reduction in ldl c with the use of more potent statins had an additive effect on the prevention of cv events. findings of 5 rcts with more than 39 000 individuals combined showed that reducing ldl c levels in over 20 mg dl with a more intensive lipid lowering treatment can decrease the incidence of non fatal myocardial infarction by 19 ischemic cva by 31 and major cv events by 28 . the use of statins in patients with cad seems to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and can even lead to their volumetric reduction 95 with an approximately linear relationship between the decrease in ldl c and the rate of cv events as well as between ldl c levels and the progression of the atheroma volume in carotid arteries. in parallel not only the dose of statin and the reduction in ldl c decrease cv risk but the period of statin use also seems to have a central role in reducing the risk for cv death and non fatal myocardial infarction. in the woscops study for instance the number needed to treat nnt with pravastatin after four years of follow up was 40 1 whereas after 16 years nnt decreased to 27 1.96 regarding lipid targets for patients in secondary prevention the scenario was redesigned after the publication of the improve it study97 with simvastatin and ezetimibe whose ldl c was 50 mg dl and the fourier study98 alirocumab a pcsk9 inhibitor which reached mean ldl c levels as low as 38 mg dl. based on the significant and consistent reduction in coronary events in two clinical trials currently the ldl c target is 50 mg dl there is no reason however in terms of safety to seek even lower targets either through diet statins ezetimibe or pcsk9 inhibitors. in a primary prevention scenario the reduction in vascular events is comparatively lower than in secondary prevention but it still is robustly cost effective in diabetic and non diabetic patients with cv risk 7.5 in 10 years.99 as revealed in the ctt meta analysis a decrease in ldl c by 80 mg dl with a mean starting ldl c from 130 to 160 mg dl combined with an effective statin regimen for about five years in 10 000 patients in primary prevention typically prevents 500 vascular events 5 of patients .14 although the duration of clinical studies with statins is relatively short 3 to 7 years patients with dm and ms will be subject to a metabolically unfavorable environment for the rest of their lives 10 to 30 years . assuming that 68 of causes of death in diabetic patients are cv related 78 it is reasonable to think that once the high vascular risk is identified based on the ors with or without cacs more aggressive therapeutic targets should be considered. no rct has investigated an ldl c target below 70 mg dl jupiter 100 in primary prevention. however mendelian randomization studies consistently support that lower ldl c levels including the 30 50 mg dl range were related to lower cv morbidity and mortality.101 furthermore a subanalysis of the jupiter study showed that the lower the ldl c level achieved 50 mg dl the greater the risk reduction in both diabetic and non diabetic individuals.102 3.2.7. aspirin in primary prevention the use of acetylsalicylic acid asa in primary prevention is a controversial issue but that seems to have recently reached a common denominator. in 2018 three rct provided an answer to this question the ascend 103 in diabetic patients the arrive 104 in non diabetic patients at moderate cv risk median risk of 15 in 10 years and the aspree 105 in patients aged 70 years or older. all three studies compared low doses of aspirin 100 mg per day with placebo from 5 arrive and aspree to 7.5 years ascend and collectively found 1 no difference in rates of myocardial infarction and acute myocardial infarction 2 no difference in cv mortality 3 no difference in all cause mortality in ascend and arrive and a small risk increase with aspirin in aspree and 4 greater risk for gastrointestinal malignancy among aspirin users in the aspree study probably due to early diagnosis . these data are consistent with a systematic review by the antithrombotic trialists collaboration 106 which included 95 000 individuals from six rct. the reduction in risk for vascular events ranged from 0.57 to 0.51 per year placebo vs. aspirin while extracranial and major gastrointestinal bleedings increased by 0.03 per year 0.10 to 0.07 . although observational studies suggest that the use of aspirin benefits primary prevention in patients at high cv risk 107 this result was not confirmed in subanalyses of ascend and arrive. even in patients at higher estimated risk for cv events aspirin provided no net benefit since it induced more bleedings in this subpopulation and the proportional decrease in vascular events was mild compared to that in individuals at lower risk.103 104 3.2.8. hypoglycemic agents in patients with diabetes mellitus despite the strong effect of glycemic control on microvascular complications among diabetic patients its benefits for the macrovascular disease were still a paradigm until recently. medicines such as sulfonylurea and insulin have limitations despite being very effective in glycemic control as they induce weight gain and increase the risk for hypoglycemia two major risk factors for the worsening of symptoms and prognosis in hf and cad. several rct tested these drugs combined with metformin by comparing intensive glycemic control and less aggressive targets. in a meta analysis with 13 rct and 34 533 diabetic individuals although the risk for non fatal myocardial infarction decreased with intensive glycemic control relative risk rr 0.85 95 confidence interval 0.74 0.96 p 0.001 there was no significant change in all cause mortality rr 1.04 99 confidence interval 0.91 1.19 or cv mortality rr 1.11 95 confidence interval 0.86 1.43 .108 809 updated updated

control associated with weight loss and minimal risk for hypoglycemia the paradigm of glycemic control regarding cvd was broken. in a recent meta analysis glp 1 analogs consistently reduced the incidence of cv deaths and non fatal infarction by 14 and 18 respectively.109 data from the studies leader liraglutide 110 sustain 6 semaglutide 55 harmony albiglutide 111 and rewind dulaglutide

percentage of individuals with a bmi 25 kg m2 rose from 28.8 to 36.9 in men and 29.8 to 38.0 in women.115 in brazil 52.4 of the population was overweight in 2014 with 17.9 of them classified as obese.116 according to data from the 2018 risk factors surveillance and chronic disease protection by telephone survey vigitel the incidence of overweight reached 55.8 and of obesity 18.7 among men over 20 years of age while for women these values were 53.9 and 20.7 respectively.117 in 34 years the prevalence of obesity increased over four times for men from 2.8 to 12.4 and more than twice for women from 8 to 16.9 .118 119 brazil currently holds the fourth place among the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity and the number of overweight adults will exceed those with low weight.118 there is a significant rise in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents regardless of gender and social status and a considerable proportion of these individuals will become obese adults. obesity has a multifactorial nature and is one of the leading factors to explain the growth in the chronic ncd burden given its frequent association with cvd such as arterial hypertension ah cva hf 120 dyslipidemias type 2 diabetes atrial fibrillation 121 122 osteoarthritis and certain types of cancer. also obesity is an important condition that predisposes the individual to mortality.118 119 in addition weight gain over time is associated with ms increased risk for cva and death in late stages of life.123 125 many patients who present some of these changes have hypertriglyceridemia and increased levels of plasma fatty acids stored as lipid droplets in the heart. intramyocardial lipids that exceed the storage and oxidation capacity can become toxic and lead to non ischemic and non hypertensive cardiomyopathy known as diabetic or lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.126 significant weight loss 5 of initial weight improves bp ldl c tg and glucose levels delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.127 4.2. primary prevention according to the world health organization who an inadequate diet is the main risk factor for early mortality worldwide.128 therefore a healthy diet is recommended for everyone and the ability to prepare healthy meals has beneficial correlations with the consumption of equally healthy foods.129 however studies have shown a reduction in the habit of cooking in some countries which has encouraged health specialists to elaborate nutritional education strategies focused on nutrients and tools such as the proper purchase and storage of food and planning and preparing meals at home.130 also we emphasize that the biological moment that could prevent weight gain is of the utmost importance. in females the moment of greatest risk seems to be the reproductive age specifically during pregnancy and the first two years postpartum and the period post menopause.131 132 among children and adolescents prevention of excessive weight gain was expected precisely because the growth phase requires extra energy and the possibility of energy expenditure is higher compared to other life stages. these potential facilitators however do not seem to overcome the factors associated with obesity and those responsible for the epidemic growth also in these age groups and life stages.133 in this regard we underline the so called obesogenic environment that is the role of the food industry fast food chains advertisements tv shows movies and videogames leading to situations that keep the children more sedentary and subjected to excessive energy intake. the most appropriate interventions should combine environmental and behavioral changes.134 136 a study conducted with 422 adolescents with a mean age of 12.5 years compared students who practiced competitive physical activity daily for 2 hours with those from a standard school who have only one hour of physical activity per week. the percentage of overweight obesity in the first group was 49.8 and in the second 37.3 which reveals the high prevalence of this change in the two groups.137 a similar sample submitted to a multidisciplinary program of moderate intensity that could be easily incorporated in the daily routine showed positive advances in risk factors when compared to the control group.138 among adults studies show a decline in the consumption of rice and beans increase in the intake of processed products particularly cookies and soft drinks excessive consumption of sugar more saturated fats and insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables creating an environment with habits that do not favor a healthy dietary pattern directly associated with the increase in chronic ncd especially obesity.139 142 a recommendation from the 2014 dietary guidelines for the brazilian population proposes 10 steps for a healthy diet 1. prioritize natural or minimally processed foods 2. use oil salt and sugar moderately 3. limit the consumption of processed foods 4. avoid the intake of ultra processed foods 5. eat regularly and carefully 6. buy food at the street market 7. cook 8. plan the purchase of foods and preparation of meals 9. avoid fast food 10. be critical of food advertising. some other useful pieces of advice are 143 144 eat regularly throughout the day and at similar times every day to establish a healthy dietary pattern pay attention to food labels and choose products without trans and hydrogenated fats avoid soft drinks and processed juices cakes cookies sandwich cookies and sweet desserts give preference to drinking water between meals practice at least 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity on most weekdays or 40 minutes of moderate physical activity however individuals with a tendency towards obesity or with family profile should practice moderate physical activity for 45 60 minutes per day those who were obese and lost weight should practice for 60 90 minutes to avoid regaining the weight lost the practice of physical activities and exercises can prevent weight gain and obesity even in older adults. table 4.1 lists the recommendations on how to approach overweight and obese adults. 811 updated updated

ah is the most prevalent chronic disease in the world affecting approximately one third of the adult population. bp is maintained by several factors particularly the intravascular volume cardiac output peripheral vascular resistance and the elasticity of arterial vessels. among the various regulatory mechanisms raas involving the renal system has significant participation an imbalance in this complex regulatory system however can result in chronic elevation of bp levels known as ah. ah is one of the most important cv risk factors as hypertensive individuals present much more atherosclerosis leading to cva hf coronary disease peripheral vascular insufficiency and kidney disease.145 although we have efficient drugs with few adverse effects the worldwide control of this condition still leaves much to be desired since we are dealing with completely asymptomatic disease a fact that makes care adherence very difficult. according to the 7th brazilian guideline of arterial hypertension an individual is hypertensive when his or her sbp and diastolic blood pressure dbp are equal to or higher than 140 90 mmhg table 5.1 .146 figure 5.1 shows the flowchart for the diagnosis of hypertension. the genesis of primary ah is multifactorial with genetic and environmental influences. although the genetic mechanisms involved are still obscure there is evidence that children of hypertensive individuals have a greater chance of becoming hypertensive. however the environmental aspect has an essential role in the development of ah. as the individual ages the prevalence of ah increases significantly therefore detecting predisposing factors is important to prevent this critical cv risk factor properly. besides family history age ethnicity and insulin resistance there are also environmental factors related to the development of ah that can be modified such as obesity psychosocial aspects diet sodium intake sedentary lifestyle and alcohol consumption. 5.2. physical activity and hypertension epidemiological studies suggest that regular aerobic physical activity can be beneficial in preventing and treating hypertension as well as reducing cv risk and mortality. a meta analysis with 93 articles and 5 223 individuals showed that aerobic training dynamic resistance and isometric resistance reduce sbp and dbp at rest by 3.5 2.5 1.8 3.2 and 10.9 6.2 mmhg respectively in the general population.147 resistance training but not other types of training further reduces bp in hypertensive individuals 8.3 5.2 mmhg . regular physical activity of lower intensity and duration reduces bp less than moderate or vigorous training but is associated with a decrease in mortality by at least 15 in cohort studies.148 149 this evidence suggests that hypertensive patients should be advised to practice dynamic aerobic exercise of moderate intensity walking running cycling or swimming for at least 30 minutes 5 to 7 days per week. the practice of resistive exercises 2 to 3 days per week could also be recommended. also healthy adults could benefit from gradually increasing moderate aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week vigorous aerobic physical activity to 150 minutes per week or an equivalent combination of the two ideally with supervised daily exercise.6 9 the impact of isometric exercises on bp and cv risk is less well established. table 5.2 demonstrates the classification of physical activity intensity and the levels of absolute and relative intensity. table 5.3 shows the v goals to prevent and treat ah.

some psychosocial factors such as work and family stress depression anxiety hostility and type d personality as well as low socioeconomic and cultural status increase the risk for ah and consequently cvd and reduce the adherence to a healthy lifestyle and drug treatment. on the other hand cvd also increase the risk of manifesting these psychosocial factors indicating a bidirectional and robust relationship.154 moreover the prevalence of cvd and ah is higher in developing countries where the control rate of these diseases tends to be poor decreasing life expectancy and increasing the pathologies and frailties related to aging.155 several prospective studies and systematic reviews have addressed socioeconomic status showing that low schooling and income low status jobs as well as living in poor residential areas are associated with the increase in bp levels and consequently cv risk.156 157 individuals with mood and personality disorders present an increase in the incidence and worsening of the prognosis of cvd especially among those with depression or anxiety.157 similarly personality traits associated with hostility or distress also worsen the prognosis.158 the management of psychosocial stress with several existing techniques among them meditation music therapy yoga and slow breathing can be crucial in preventing and controlling bp. in general such techniques can mildly reduce bp levels in hypertensive individuals.159 160 5.4. diets that promote the prevention and control of arterial hypertension in 2017 the global burden of disease group considered unhealthy diet as one of the main as risk factors for premature death and disability.161 adjustments in the diet of individuals with normotension nt or pre hypertension ph have the potential of reducing bp and preventing ah.162 national and international guidelines recommend that all patients with ph or ah reduce their sodium intake and consume adequate amounts of fresh fruit vegetables and low fat dairy products.163 furthermore these documents emphasize the importance of maintaining body weight and waist circumference within the normal range.164 many dietary patterns have been proposed to prevent and control ah as well as maintain global and cv health. among the dietary models proposed with different levels of evidence and effectiveness to prevent and control ah we highlight the dietary approaches

meta analyses have evaluated the potential effects of additives on bp reduction with supplementation of certain substances in populations of individuals with nt ph and ah.166 the effects of these supplements on bp reduction are usually mild heterogeneous and their statistical significance is difficult to assess. the substances whose supplementation has evidence of significant bp reduction are potassium vitamin c food derived bioactive peptides garlic dietary fiber linseed dark chocolate cocoa soy organic nitrates and omega 3.167 chart 5.2 shows the recommended mean daily portions their potential impact on bp the level of evidence and the recommendation grade of each of these supplements as well as other food interventions. supplementation with calcium magnesium combined vitamins tea and coenzyme q10 did not present a significant bp reduction.168 5.5. alcohol and hypertension the relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension is known since 1915 when a pioneer publication reported this association.169 several epidemiological studies corroborate the almost linear and dose dependent relationship between alcohol and ah.170 the difficulty in determining the effect of alcohol on the development of ah is the difference in the quantification of the 814 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 consumption pattern and the varying alcohol concentration of these beverages. heterogeneous results originate from the influence of the type of beverage ingested volume consumed lifestyle intake pattern and socioeconomic status of the population studied.171 172 the intersalt study evaluated the consumption of 300 ml of ethanol weekly 34 g 3 or 4 drinks day and found a bp increase in drinkers compared to non drinkers.173 estimates indicate that excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for approximately 10 30 of ah cases.174 the aric study followed 8 834 individuals for eight years and at the end of the investigation the patients with high alcohol consumption had a greater incidence of ah regardless of the type of beverage gender or ethnicity. moderate alcohol consumption was associated with risk of developing ah not only in african americans but also in the brazilian population.175 approximately 6 of all cause mortality worldwide is attributed to alcohol.176 when ingested in a single dose alcohol has a dose dependent biphasic effect characterized by bp reduction vasodilation and increase in hr with a subsequent bp elevation.177 in a study using the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring abpm in pre menopausal women the group who consumed 20 300 ml of red wine day 146 218 g of alcohol week showed a significant increase in bp.178 the same situation occurred in normotensive men who ingested an average of 40 g day of ethanol compared to the group who did not consume alcohol for four weeks.179 a meta analysis with 15 rcts involving 2 234 participants assessed the effects of reducing the consumption of ethanol on bp and estimated that a 2 mmhg reduction in dbp could decrease the prevalence of ah by 17 the cad risk by 6 and the ischemic cva and transient ischemic attack by 15 .180 5.6. weight loss and prevention of arterial hypertension overweight is recognized as a factor related to bp elevation and the greater the bmi the higher risk for ah.181 central obesity and weight gain over time stand out as important factors for the development of ah. the nurses health study revealed that women who gained 5.0 to 9.9 kg and those who gained more than 25 kg in 18 years of follow up had a higher risk for ah 1.7 and 5.2 respectively. however estimates suggest that only 26 to 40 of ah cases are attributable to overweight emphasizing the multifactorial nature of ah.182 weight loss as a non pharmacological approach reduces bp in normotensive individuals and can prevent the development of ah. changes in lifestyle are crucial for weight loss focusing on the adoption of a hypocaloric diet and regular pa with the reduction in caloric intake being more important than following specific diets.183 regular isolated pa without a concomitant dietary approach rich in fruits vegetables grains seeds nuts fish and dairy products and poor in meats sugars and alcohol in general is not enough for a significant weight loss.184 a meta analysis of controlled studies with 4 184 individuals showed a reduction in sbp and dbp of 1.05 and 0.92 mmhg respectively for each 1 kg of weight lost. in healthy obese individuals the combination of a low calorie diet and bmi reduction was associated with an average decrease of 4.73 2.75 mmhg in sbp and dbp.185 a systematic review of studies with hypertensive subjects showed that the magnitude of bp reduction with weight loss was on average 4.5 3.2 mmhg for sbp and dbp respectively underlining that the greater the weight loss the higher the bp reduction.186 the framingham study revealed a reduction in the risk of developing ah of 22 to 26 in individuals aged 30 49 and 50 65 years respectively who maintained a weight loss of 6.8 kg in 8 years. in this context regular pa stands as a measure of great importance in the maintenance of weight loss.187 5.7. low sodium diet in the prevention of arterial hypertension prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that high sodium intake increases the risk of death and cv events. these studies also reported that decreasing sodium intake to below a certain value approximately 3 g of sodium per day further reduced bp. paradoxically low sodium intake was associated with an increased cv risk and risk of all cause mortality in the general population and hypertensive individuals suggesting a j curve phenomenon. the mechanism of this apparent increased risk with low sodium intake is probably related to higher activity in the renin angiotensin system under a very high restriction of salt in the diet. no epidemiological study has evidenced that very low sodium intake can be harmful.10 on the other hand there is evidence of a causal relationship between sodium intake and an increase in bp. excessive sodium intake 5 g of sodium per day increases bp and is associated with a higher prevalence of systolic ah with aging.188 many studies have shown that sodium restriction decreases bp. a meta analysis revealed that a reduction of 1.75 g of sodium per day 4.4 g of salt day was associated with an average decrease of 4.2 and 2.1 mmhg in sbp and dbp respectively with a more pronounced effect in hypertensive individuals 5.4 and 2.8 mmhg. the reducing effect of sodium restriction on bp is more significant in black people older adults and individuals with dm ms and chronic kidney disease ckd .164 in western populations such as the brazilian the usual sodium intake is estimated between 3.5 to 5.5 g day which corresponds to 9 to 12 g of salt per day with marked differences among countries or even regions.189 sodium intake should be limited to approximately 2.0 g day equivalent to about 5.0 g of salt per day in the population in general but especially in hypertensive individuals. the effective reduction of salt is not easy and information about which foods have high levels of salt is often scarce. it is crucial that the population pay very careful attention to the amount of salt added to meals and with foods high in salt processed products . reducing salt intake remains a public health priority but it requires a combined effort between the food industry governments and the general population since 80 of the salt consumed originates from processed foods. the adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables enhances 815 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of

taken in the doctor s office the recommended bp target is 130 80 mmhg for individuals with stages 1 and 2 hypertension at low and moderate cv risk and those with stage 3 hypertension at low moderate and high cv risk.146 this recommendation is based on meta analyses of randomized studies 193 194 which demonstrated the superiority of this bp target compared to values above 150 90 mmhg. decreasing this target to 130 80 mmhg seems to be safe in this lower risk population as observational195 and some randomized studies corroborate 194 196 although the additional benefit is relatively small and counterbalanced by the risk for symptomatic hypotension and adverse effects of drugs. on the other hand individuals with stages 1 and 2 hypertension at high or very high cv risk or with three or more risk factors and or ms and or target organ damage should have bp levels 130 80 mmhg.146 in the sprint study 197 among the 9 361 non diabetic individuals at high cv risk median of 24.8 in 10 years 39

to the risk for coronary hypoperfusion myocardial damage and cv events.146 a j curve has been consistently identified in this population with sbp 120 mmhg and dbp 70 mmhg being associated with higher mortality.200 6. vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids 6.1. introduction several observational studies have found a strong association between the consumption of grains fruits and vegetables foods rich in vitamins and minerals and low cv mortality201 and lower risk for myocardial infarction.202 given this strong evidence numerous intervention studies have tested the impact of supplementation with micronutrients vitamins and certain fatty acids omega 3 series on primary and secondary prevention of cv events. from a practical point of view most of these studies showed no clinical benefit related to supplementation in the doses studied and in the face of the drug therapies used to prevent cv. tables 6.1. to 6.3 summarize the recommendations for and against the use of these supplements. 6.2. carotenoids carotenoids are a class with over 600 compounds responsible for the yellow red and orange pigments in plants with carotene carotene cryptoxanthin lycopene lutein and zeaxanthin being the most commonly found in food. known primarily as precursors of vitamin a carotenoids are also essential suppressors of free radicals and act as potent antioxidants.203 the evidence for the role of carotenoids in cvd originated from studies showing that increased consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk for cvd.204 a series of retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies identified an inverse association between carotenoid intake and risk for cvd.204 however the effect of carotenoids is complex and probably does not result from a single isolated compound. in contrast prospective randomized studies showed no benefit of carotenoid supplementation for cvd.204 205 corroborating this information a cross sectional analysis consisting of 894 members of the cohort study kardiovize revealed that the consumption of foods containing vitamins carotene zinc selenium and vitamins a and c was associated with a reduction in the intimal thickening of the

antioxidant index to categorize the foods excluding individuals who used antioxidant supplements. therefore the use of supplements only with carotenoids carotene or similar compounds is not recommended. instead efforts should be directed toward increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in these nutrients. 6.3. vitamin e vitamin e is the main fat soluble antioxidant in the human body and is present in a complex of four isomers and tocopherol . the interest in the potential benefit of vitamin e for risk of cvd was related to its antioxidant capacity and the possibility of modifying oxidized low density lipoprotein ox ldl particularly involved in atherogenesis.207 however prospective randomized studies such as the atbc chaos gissi and hope showed no benefit of vitamin e supplementation for cvd.205 208 the effect of supplementation with vitamin e and vitamin c on alternate days for eight years on 14 641 individuals did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction cva and cv mortality in addition to being associated with an increased incidence of hemorrhagic cva.209 despite the solid molecular basis theory of oxidative stress and its role in atherosclerosis these clinical trials do not corroborate the use of vitamin e supplementation to prevent cvd. on the other hand consuming foods containing vitamins e a and c was associated with a lower risk for adverse cv outcomes as demonstrated in the hong kong cardiovascular risk factor prevalence study crisps a longitudinal study comprising 875 participants.210 thus the consumption of foods with vitamin e has proven to be more effective and safe and vitamin e supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd. 6.4. vitamin d vitamin d is an important precursor of the steroid hormone calcitriol which is crucial for mineral and bone metabolism. in addition it has other functions and supplementation with this vitamin to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases has increased considerably in the past decade.211 its two main forms are vitamin d2 ergocalciferol and d3 cholecalciferol . vitamin d3 can be synthesized by human skin cells after exposure to uv b radiation from sunlight. in the absence of sunlight the intake of vitamin d is crucial. vitamin d and dietary supplements are absorbed by the intestine and then converted into 25 hydroxyvitamin d3 25 oh d in the liver and 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin d3 1.25 oh 2d3 the active form of vitamin d in the kidney. zittermann et al.212 summarized the underlying mechanisms for the potential role of vitamin d in preventing coronary disease. they include inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle suppressing vascular calcification down regulating pro inflammatory cytokines up regulating anti inflammatory

endocrine regulator of the renin angiotensin system. low concentrations of circulating vitamin d were associated with ah obesity dm and ms furthermore observational studies associated the deficiency of this vitamin with the risk for cvd.212 213 some ecological studies suggest that vitamin d has a role in cvd showing an increase in cardiac disease events according to the geographical latitude that is associated with lower exposure to solar radiation with the concentration of vitamin d decreasing with latitude. several prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin d and cvd indicating an inverse relationship between the concentrations of this vitamin in the blood and the risk for cvd.213 214 despite this evidence data from a systematic review conducted by beveridge et al.215 showed a lack of consistent benefit of vitamin d supplementation for the main markers of endothelial and vascular function.215 a randomized controlled double blind study that lasted 5.3 years tested the efficiency of daily supplementation with 2 000 iu of vitamin d3 cholecalciferol in 25 871 participants.216 the primary outcomes assessed were myocardial infarction cva and mortality from all cv causes in addition to secondary outcomes of cv events. vitamin d supplementation did not result in a lower incidence of cv events compared to placebo. the vida vitamin d assessment trial involved 5 108 participants in new zealand aged 50 84 years. in the treatment group participants received an initial dose of 200 000 iu followed a month later by 100 000 iu or placebo for an average of 3.3 years. the study found no significant reduction in cvd and mortality in the group that received vitamin d in comparison with the placebo group.217 although observational studies demonstrate a positive association between low concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin d and the risk for cv events its supplementation is not indicated to prevent cv at the moment. however studies with an adequate design still need to prospectively investigate populations with prominent deficiencies especially patients with ckd and other doses of this vitamin.218 6.5. vitamin k the review prepared by the cochrane library could not assess the effectiveness of vitamin k supplementation in decreasing all cause mortality including cv and non fatal outcomes myocardial infarction cva and angina in depth because only one study met the pre established inclusion criteria.219 this study comprised 60 individuals aged 40 65 years investigated for three months and revealed that vitamin k2 did not change their bp and concentration of plasma lipids. the very limited results of this review highlight the lack of robust data about the efficiency of vitamin k in the primary prevention of cvd. however the authors declared that the evidence for this assertion was minimal. a recent systematic review and meta analysis registered as the prospero study analyzed the results of 13 clinical trials that evaluated the effects of vitamin k supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy individuals or a population at high risk for cvd. the study found no benefit for plasma lipids inflammatory cytokines such as crp and interleukin 6 sbp and dbp both in healthy individuals and among those at cv risk.220 therefore the literature has no evidence to recommend vitamin k for cv prevention. 6.6. vitamin c vitamin c or ascorbic acid is soluble in water and a very effective antioxidant since it loses electrons easily. the free radical theory of the aging process clarifies its role in the progression of chronic diseases.207 the japan collaborative cohort study jacc 221 assessed food intake in 23 119 men and 35 611 women aged 40 to 79 years without a history of cvd and showed that the consumption of foods rich in vitamin c was inversely associated with mortality from cvd in japanese women. despite the beneficial effects of consuming foods rich in vitamin c shown in observational studies rcts do not confirm the efficiency of its supplementation in primary or secondary prevention of cvd.222 consequently vitamin c supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd. 6.7. b vitamins and folate evidence of a connection between vitamin b and cvd was demonstrated by the effect of these vitamins on the reduction of homocysteine.223 224 homocysteine an amino acid containing sulfur is a metabolite produced indirectly in the demethylation of methionine. prospective studies have shown an independent but modest association between plasma concentrations of homocysteine and the risk for cvd.223 some factors identified as associated with high concentrations of homocysteine are inadequate intake of folic acid and vitamins b6 and or b12 for this reason the growth in plasma concentrations of homocysteine can only be one follow up marker of an inadequate diet. other factors that might be associated with increased homocysteine include preexisting atherosclerotic disease consumption of coffee and alcohol smoking dm use of antiepileptic drugs or methotrexate renal failure rheumatoid arthritis ra hypothyroidism and cystathionine beta synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations. prospective randomized studies with a large number of cv events failed to show any benefit of folate and b complex supplementation in reducing homocysteine and preventing cvd.208 the disagreement between the results of epidemiological studies and clinical trials might be partially due to the inclusion of different populations and the use of folic acid fortified foods in some countries. folic acid or b complex supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd.224 a recent observational study conducted in 195 countries reiterated the efficiency of consuming foods containing vitamins to prevent cv risk and mortality associating the mortality rate of cvd attributed to diet with low intake of fruits grains and vegetables.164 in conclusion based on current evidence a diet rich in vitamins must be encouraged however there is no indication that supplementation with these compounds can prevent cv events. 6.8. omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid omega 3 fatty acids of marine origin docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa produce numerous effects on different physiological and metabolic 819 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 aspects that can influence the chance of developing cvd.225 226 despite the general agreement that regular consumption of fish rich in omega 3 fatty acids is part of a healthy diet recommending dietary supplementation with fish oil capsules is controversial fostered by conflicting results of clinical studies.32 227 229 6.9. effects of omega 3 on the lipid profile clinical studies show that 2 to 4 grams of epa dha supplementation per day can reduce tg levels by up to 25 to 30 slightly increase hdl c 1 to 3 and raise ldl c by 5 10 .32 the ability to decrease tg levels depends on the dose with a reduction of approximately 5 to 10 for each 1 g of epa dha consumed per day which can be higher in individuals with greater baseline tg concentrations. these data show that high doses of omega 3 supplementation can be used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. 6.10. omega 3 and cardiovascular outcomes in a meta analysis of 36 rct supplementation with fish oil median dose of 3.7 g day reduced sbp by 3.5 mmhg and dbp by 2.4 mmhg.230 the decrease in adrenergic tonus and systemic vascular resistance is a proposed mechanism. although several old pieces of evidence suggest a protective effect of fish and omega 3 fatty acids of marine origin on cv events 230 particularly in individuals with established cvd more recent studies showed no benefit of omega 3 supplementation for subjects who had or had not presented manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.227 228 in fact a meta analysis of 10 studies involving 77 917 individuals both in secondary 64 with prior coronary disease 28 with prior cva and primary prevention 37 of diabetic individuals failed to show any benefit of omega 3 supplementation epa doses ranging from 226 to 1 800 mg day and dha from 0 to 1 700 mg d after a mean follow up of 4.4 years presenting 6 273 coronary events 2 695 coronary deaths .231 these results were confirmed in an extensive systematic review and meta analysis by the cochrane group with more than 119 000 individuals from 79 randomized studies.232 also the same meta analysis did not find the benefit of supplementation with alpha linolenic acid ala the plant omega 3. possible reasons for the divergent results between old and contemporary studies concern the profile of the population studied mainly regarding the more frequent use of medicines known as protectors e.g. statins beta blockers acei the more aggressive control of traditional risk factors and the higher number of myocardial revascularization procedures in more recent studies. another difficulty in analyzing studies with omega 3 supplementation is the diversity in its composition and the lack of control regarding the intake of omega 3 in the diet. more recently two published clinical trials used low doses up to 1 g day of epa dha of omega 3 in primary prevention of cvd. one of them has assessed the role of omega 3 in the primary prevention of cvd and cancer among men over 50 years of age and women over 55 years of age vital study .233 using a formulation containing 460 mg of epa and 380 mg of dha the study included 25 871 patients with a median follow up of 5.3 years and found no benefit of omega 3 in reducing major cv event or invasive cancer.233 another study on primary prevention but in diabetic patients also examined the combination of epa dha in the same composition of the vital study. it included 15 480 diabetic patients followed for an average of 7.4 years and found no benefit of omega 3 in reducing major vascular event.234 thus the role of omega 3 fatty acids in the doses used with respect to the primary prevention of cv events is questionable. the reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl intervention trial reduce it 33 tested omega 3 in the reduction of cv outcomes among patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established cvd or diabetic patients with an additional risk factor. the patients received highly purified epa icosapent ethyl at a dose of 4 g day. the study included 8 179 patients who used statins and had tg ranging from 135 to 499 mg dl median of 216 mg dl and a median ldl c of 74 mg dl. the median reduction was 18 for tg and 6.6 for ldl c in the epa group. reduce it showed a relative decrease of 25 in composite cv outcomes among patients who received epa and an absolute risk reduction of 4.8 nnt of 22 patients to prevent an event. the hierarchical analysis demonstrated a significant decrease of 20 in cv mortality. on the other hand the risk of hospitalization for atrial flutter or fibrillation presented a relative increase of 67 1 absolute with the treatment. the reduction of events in the reduce it study is similar to the results of the japan epa lipid intervention study jelis in which 1.8 g day of epa also led to a significant decrease in cv events among individuals who already used low doses of statins.227 however the results of this last study are limited by their open design and lack of a placebo group. data from these studies suggest that high doses of epa 4 g can be used in patients with prior cvd and who remain with elevated tg levels despite taking statins to prevent cvd. however there is no evidence for the use of lower doses and other formulations of omega 3 for cv prevention both primary and secondary. we emphasize however that several studies are still testing moderate to high doses of epa and epa dha in individuals at high risk for cvd who present persistent moderately high tg. 6.11. omega 3 in heart failure the gissi heart failure gissi hf trial evaluated the role of omega 3 in hf.235 this study randomized patients with chronic hf functional class ii iv of different etiologies to receive 1 g of omega 3 epa dha n 3 494 or placebo n 3 481 per day.235 the primary outcome was time to death and time to death or hospitalization for cv causes. during a median follow up of 3.9 years the omega 3 group presented lower mortality rate 27 versus 29 hr 0.91 95 confidence interval 0.83 0.99 p 0.041 with nnt 56 and lower incidence of primary outcome 57 versus 59 hr 0.92 95 confidence interval 0.84 0.99 p 0.009 with nnt 44 .235 data from this study however need to be confirmed. 820 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 6.12. omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of plant origin ala has shown inconsistent effects on lipid levels.236 237 a systematic review and meta analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with ala supplementation found no significant influence on tc ldl c or tg and only a minimal effect on hdl c a 0.4 mg dl reduction .238 specifically the effects of linseed on experimental animals range from zero to a slight lipid decrease and a review suggested a reducing impact on tg due to humans consuming large amounts of linseed oil.238 observational studies indicate a modest reduction in the risk for cvd with the consumption of ala.238 data from the alpha omega study showed no benefits of ala supplementation in preventing cvd among individuals who had a prior cvd. more recent data from the cochrane group meta analysis suggest that increasing the intake of ala probably makes little or no difference in all cause mortality cv mortality and coronary events.232 its effects on cva are unclear. however the authors recognize the low quality of most studies therefore further studies on ala supplementation are necessary to prove or refute its effectiveness in preventing cvd. we can conclude that at the moment there is no evidence to recommend ala supplementation to prevent cvd. table 3.3 presents the recommendations for ala consumption and supplementation. 7. smoking 7.1. introduction smoking control in brazil has been considered as a model not only for its programming but for the results with tobacco use being reduced by at least half when compared to the last decades of the 1900s. increased cost effective taxes a ban on advertising a ban on indoor use smoke free laws the sale of tobacco products to minors discussion of the subject in the school curriculum and warnings and information about harmful effects of smoking on schools universities the media and on cigarette packs themselves were effective measures to reduce smoking. there are currently over one billion smokers in the world. brazil is considered one of the countries in the world that has most reduced the prevalence of smokers in the last thirty years. in 1989 about 32 of the population over the age of 15 were smokers according to the national health and nutrition survey of the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge . in 2018 the vigitel survey of the ministry of health through a telephone survey in 27 brazilian cities found a frequency of adult smokers over 18 years of age of 10.1 being higher in males 13.2 and lower in females 7.5 . the highest frequencies were found in men between the cities of curitiba and porto alegre 17.3 and s o paulo 15.6 .239 for the cv system continued long term use of tobacco and its derivatives leads to the onset of chronic diseases which will manifest around 30 years after the start of regular smoking. as most smokers become addicted to nicotine before age 18 the health consequences are disastrous given the long exposure of the body to the harmful components contained in cigarettes. therefore prevention is the key to this health catastrophe. smoking prevention despite worldwide tobacco control efforts the number of nicotine addicts is still substantial. effective public policies against the sale advertising and use of cigarettes in public areas are important tools in primary prevention as they prevent non smokers especially children and adolescents from being exposed to nicotine. therefore the experimentation rate should be reduced in young people under 15 years of age. this initiative will surely reduce the number of potential tobacco users. primordial prevention of smoking primordial prevention of smoking is understood to be established before the initiation of smoking. it first identifies the risk factors for smoking with a wide range from the individual s own vulnerability such as the surrounding social determinants. providing a personalized and continuing education and enabling information exchange requires the formation of a multidisciplinary team.240 the aim of this team is to work with individuals and their families on the risks of smoking to outline strategies to prevent them from smoking and to promote health.241 242 factors that contribute to starting smoking 1. attitudes and beliefs a study of adolescents243 showed that 40 of those who had never smoked became experimenters and that 8 had a smoking habit for 4 consecutive years.244 the lack of a firm decision not to smoke was the strongest predictor of experimenting 2. influence of friends and family the presence of smokers among family and friends is an important predictor of tobacco initiation during adolescence refusing a cigarette in the face of social pressure is a challenge for most teenagers and only 44 of them can refuse a cigarette at a party 245 3. age both positive and negative attitudes towards smoking are more pronounced in adolescence 246 4. false conception adolescents tend to overestimate the frequency of smoking among adults247 and to underestimate their own 248 5. advertinsing magazines and movies are main advertising sources promoting adolescent smoking 6. nicotine dependence nicotine is a highly addictive substance and many individuals develop dependence after a few days or weeks of exposure.249 young people are more vulnerable than adullts to nicotine dependence 250 7. other risk factors depression the majority of studies show a relation between the presence of depression and the initiation of smoking allthough it is not clear if the association is causal poor school performance missing classes and poor school performance are associated with initiation and continuation of smoking 251 252 253 adverse experiences separation of parents or divorce physical emotions emotional physical or sexual abuse growing up among family members who are addicted mentally ill or imprisoned 254 255 substance abuse there is a high frequency of smokers among adolescents who use illicit drugs 256 so every 821 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 adolescent who smokes should be considered potentially engaged in other risky behaviors. 7.2. strategies in combating smoking initiation257 258 one way to approach primordial prevention is by age groups observing for each group five main items 5 as group 0 to 4 years ask parents and other family members about their smoking habits advise to keep the environment free of cigarette smoke the message should include information about the risks to parents and children as well as the importance of the parental model assess willingness to cooperate between parents and other family members assist parents with trying to quit by informing them about self help material and or referring them to their own doctors make an appointment with clinic within 3 months if a relative is a smoker check parental progress at each subsequent pediatric visit. 5 to 12 years old group ask children about how they feel when someone is smoking nearby and what they do about it if they think it is dangerous to try smoking and if they think they will smoke when they are older if they have tried smoking or if they have friends who smoke advise children not to try smoking praise them for remaining a non smoker and or staying away from cigarette smoke remind children about the short term negative effects of tobacco such as reduced ability to smell and athletic capacity as well as personal health risks e g. asthma exacerbation advise parents to quit smoking and to give clear anti smoking information to their children assess the risk factors of smoking initiation or regular smoking progression including level of experimentation smoking among friends depressive symptoms school performance and adverse experiences help parents in trying to quit smoking assist children with developing skills to refuse smoking and exposure to it assist parents in efforts to prevent tobacco use by their children through parenting and firm anti smoking messages make an appointment with clinic within 1 2 months for any child who is smoking or has worrisome risk factors for smoking refer as necessary cases of social or learning difficulties and mental disorders as well. group of adolescents and young adults ask adolescents about smoking behavior confidentially about friends who smoke and about light cigarettes advise adolescents to stop smoking reinforcing personal health risks and danger of addiction commend adolescents who are not smoking and remind them about the health risks assess the motivation and symptoms of tobacco dependence among adolescents who are smoking assess risk factors for smoking initiation among non smokers assist adolescents who are smoking with trying to quit including nicotine replacement and referring if necessary help parents with their efforts to prevent smoking initiation among their children through parenting and firm anti smoking information make an appointment with clinic within one month for each teenager who is smoking supporting attempts to quit or assessing motivation and barriers to quitting refer as necessary if risk factors are identified such as social or learning difficulties or findings of mental disorders. primordial prevention of cvd in its broadest context it involves avoiding the establishment of modifiable cvd risk factors including smoking and effective strategies for promoting cv health of the individual and the population. therefore the joint action of interdiscipline teams doctors nurses psychologists physical educators educators nutritionists social workers communicators managers and intersectoral family school government society specialists university teams is necessary in a continuous and simultaneous way. 7.3. how to treat smoker s psychological dependence nicotine addiction is a highly complex process that should be addressed by all health professionals. every healthcare professional especially the doctor during consultations as well as the multidisciplinary team should ask if the patient is a smoker. this question is essential. if the patient is a smoker two types of approach can be used. basic approach where the goal is to ask if you smoke to evaluate the smoker s profile to advise to quit smoking to prepare for cessation and to accompany the smoker to the cessation of smoking. this approach should always be performed by the physician during the routine consultation with an average duration of 3 minimum to 5 maximum minutes with each contact the patient makes. the patient should be questioned and asked systematically at each consultation and feedback on the evolution of the cessation process. suitable for all smokers. meta analysis involving 29 studies showed that cessation rates were 19.9 for those who underwent medical intervention.259 specific intensive approach performed by health professionals available and trained to make a more in depth follow up with the patient including the doctor. in this case the professional should have a structured program available to the patient with scheduled sessions 8 group individual sessions and will use national reference medication for treatment of smoking as well as the cognitive behavioral approach. if possible the patient should be followed up to 1 year of treatment. the cognitive behavioral approach is a psychological approach that is based on working out the automatic thoughts that the smoker has and that lead him her to get a cigarette. these thoughts are often accompanied by emotion and behaviors associated with smoking. it is important for the patient to feel welcomed by the doctor to show empathy not to judge or condemn because of difficulties in smoking cessation. another aspect is that the better the smoker knows his her addiction profile the easier it is to work on ways to control smoking addiction.259 260 in the cognitive behavioral approach it is necessary to distinguish the patient s automatic dysfunctional thoughts example if i do not smoke i cannot think helping him to seek coping strategies for situations other than getting a cigarette. behavioral techniques most commonly used self observation control of stimuli or triggers that lead to smoking telephone computer alcohol bathroom car identification and learning of functional thinking patterns relaxation techniques deep breathing postponement and breaking of conditioning assertiveness training so that one can face situations where there is the temptation to smoke self instruction situations in which patients are taught to argue 822 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 with themselves about the situation that tries to induce them to smoke and problem solving so that patients are taught about appropriate ways to solve a problem situation.260 262 instruments that help in assessing and understanding the patient profile prochaska and di clemente scale for behavior change this scale provides a model that allows one to clearly and objectively evaluate which phase of behavior change the patient is in. quitting smoking is a dynamic process that repeats over time and has different stages. at each stage the individual uses different cognitive and behavioral processes.263 the authors propose five different stages in this process. pre contemplation is characterized by the absence of intention to change behavior. the individual does not perceive in this case the act of smoking as a problem. contemplation implies some awareness of the problem. it is perceived and there is an intention to change but there is no notion of when so there is no commitment. preparation is the pre action stage. there is a clear intention to change the individual already has some initiatives regarding change but the action is not yet effective. action is already a behavior change to try to solve the problem. the individual spends time looking for treatments and promotes changes that must be sustainable. maintenance is the stage at which such changes must be consolidated encompassing all that has been achieved at the action stage. the problem is that these stages do not occur sequentially in the process of change but rather in a spiral way that is the individual may be at an earlier stage and at some point for some reason regresses to an earlier stage. and then evolves again. when he returns to an early stage of pre contemplation he may relapse back to his previous smoking pattern. the individual can start the whole process again and be able to abstain once again. basic signs that indicate that the smoker is ready for change has less resistance asks fewer questions about the problem addiction asks more questions about change what and how to do it takes a resolving attitude feels decided makes more self motivational claims talks about life after change difficulties and benefits begins to experience some changes decreased smoking . motivational interviewing it is a viable alternative in the treatment of dependent behaviors within brief interventions as the initial impact seems to influence the motivation for behavior change. motivational interviewing employs a particular way of assisting in recognizing present or potential problems as well as in behavioral change aimed at solving such problems. motivational interviewing strategies providing guidance removing barriers assisting obstacles providing alternative smoking options decreasing undesirable aspects of behavior practicing empathy giving feedback clarifying objectives and actively assisting and taking care of relapse prevention coping with abstinence.264 fagerstr m scale this is an evaluation scale that allows us to determine the degree of physical dependence on nicotine. it should be used in the initial assessment of the smoker on arriving for treatment. if medication is needed it helps to determine which medication is best and how much to take.265 266 in this case it is noteworthy that the use of medication should not be considered only in cases where fagerstr m is 5. it is known today that a very low fargestr m means that psychological dependence is very high and in this case the medication helps in reducing withdrawal symptoms.260 reason for smoking scale this is a rating scale that allows us to check in which situations the smoker uses the cigarette. it has to do with physical psychological dependence and conditioning and helps to clarify to smokers the risk situations of their daily life. this scale assesses stimulation ritual handling pleasure in smoking tension reduction relaxation physical dependence habit automatism and social smoking. these items should be worked through throughout the smoker s intensive approach process.267 7.4. pharmacological treatment of smoking 7.4.1. secondary intervention smoking the cv effects of smoking are harmful so cvd is the leading cause of death among smokers.268 smokers with cvd should stop smoking.269 the safety of first line anti smoking drugs such as varenicline bupropion and nicotine replacement has been reiterated by clinical studies designed270 to answer publication questions that suggested there may be cv risk with the use of anti smoking medication.271 the cats study 270 among others proved that there is no such risk. thus respecting the contraindications of each product the use of these drugs should be encouraged so that the patient can really quit smoking as the drugs increase cessation success rates.272 the prescription of anti smoking drugs is essential for improving the effectiveness of smoking treatment as well as conducting follow up appointments and encouraging changes in patients habits and behavior.273 274 the main features of first line anti smoking drugs are 1. nicotine replacers chart 7.1 nicotine is primarily responsible for cigarette addiction and nicotine replacement therapies nrt have been used since 1984 to help smoking cessation. the forms of nrt currently used and available in brazil are transdermal and oral lozenges and chewing gums . both are effective in smoking cessation and are often used in combination and can double the rate of smoking cessation compared with placebo.268 275 2. transdermal nicotine effectiveness compared to placebo rr 1.9 95 ci 1.7 2.2 .

after meal with water between 150 and 250 ml to reduce nausea . adverse reactions the most expected side effect with this substance is nausea 30 of patients . this effect is minimized by taking the medication after meals and with a glass of water. less than 6 of patients discontinue medication because of this effect. other effects reported to a lesser extent are insomnia 14 headache 10 constipation 6 abnormal dreams dream recall and actual content and flatulence which in some circumstances require dose reduction 1 mg day but rarely cause discontinuation of medication. contraindications absolute terminal renal failure pregnancy and breastfeeding. dose adjustment in patients with severe renal failure see adjustment table . precaution for use caution should be exercised when using in patients with a history of psychiatric illness such as severe depression bipolar disorder and panic syndrome. although the causal connection has not been demonstrated and considering that smokers have a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation 280 the us food and drug administration fda in 2009 281 warned about the possibility of mood swings restlessness and suicidal ideation among users of varenicline and is therefore not recommended in patients with non stabilized psychiatric disorders. in 2011 singh et al.271 conducted a meta analysis with some varenicline studies warning of possible risks of cv events among users. after careful analysis of the study it was concluded that a significant number of patients who used varenicline in randomized trials were not included in the meta analysis and did not present with any cv event.282 prochaska and hilton283 performed a more comprehensive meta analysis including all varenicline studies and found no risk of increased cv event in the varenicline versus placebo group. the safety of varenicline was assessed by rigotti et al. 284 when they analyzed in a randomized placebo controlled manner the efficacy and safety of varenicline in patients with cvd. the authors found no additional cv risk in the varenicline group. overdose toxicity nausea feeling sick vomiting. second line medicine 1. nortriptyline nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine into the central nervous system. it is a 2nd line drug in the treatment of smoking. the fda has not yet approved its use for treatment because although its efficacy is similar to that obtained with nrt or bupropion there is a greater risk of side effects from the medication.268 281 the recommended dose is 25 mg day as a single dose gradually increasing to 75 to 100 mg per day. use is not recommended in patients with structural heart disease of any nature because of the risk of inducing conduction disorders and arrhythmia. 7.5. anti smoking drug combinations the effectiveness of first line anti smoking drugs is between 20 and 25 for nicotine replacement and bupoprione and does not exceed 35 with varenicline.268 thus we can imagine that out of 10 patients treated about 3 will quit and 7 will not. the combination of anti smoking drugs seems to be a reasonable application option to improve success rates. despite the increase in cost it should be considered that quitting smoking has an substantial cost benefit ratio so the proposal is perfectly viable leaving the perspective of dealing with the possible increase in side effects as the main factor to be managed. some studies with the combination of patches and oral nicotine have shown improved results. meta analysis of 9 studies277 that combined a nicotine patch with a nicotine rapid release drug gum spray lozenge proved to be more effective than a single type of nrt rr 1.34 95 confidence interval 1.18 to 1.51 . the combination of nrt and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone in the meta analysis of 4 studies.277 rr 1 24 95 confidence interval 1.06 to1.45 . 825 updated updated cardiovascular

varenicline does not interfere with concomitant use of digoxin metformin or warfarin. cimetidine may increase varenicline bioavailability it should be used with caution in patients with renal failure contraindication pregnancy breastfeeding less than 18 years old bipolar disorder schizophrenia or epilepsy the combination of varenicline and bupropion appears to be the most effective of all evidence b 285 however randomized studies286 of greater consistency need to be performed. 7.6. future proposals the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors has not proven to be an option for treatment of withdrawal symptoms 281 but considering how often depressive symptoms manifest during smoking cessation 285 with or without drugs 286 randomized trials to test concomitant use of this drug should be conducted to assess whether results are improving as nicotine has an action on monoaminoxidase a which is responsible for serotonin degradation among many other neurotransmitters which would explain the high frequency of this condition. smoking cessation with or without anti smoking medication. bupropion and varenicline have no action on serotonin explaining the higher frequency of mood disorders in drug users compared to those on nicotine replacement. we believe that this event is more likely to occur in varenicline users due to the high antagonist potency in the 4 2 receptor thus preventing nicotinic action even if the patient smokes. from this perspective the longitudinal observational study that evaluated the effectiveness of the combination of varenicline bupropion and sertraline287 had a better success rate among those that used all three drugs. these findings warrant corroboration through a randomized placebo controlled study so that there is indeed robust evidence of the benefit of these combinations as well as testing whether the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is confirmed as an ancillary strategy in anti smoking treatment in patients who manifest depressive symptoms during smoking treatment.288 289 nicotine vaccines 290 long awaited to comprise the therapeutic arsenal are still under study. they act by stimulating the immune system to produce specific antibodies that bind with great affinity to nicotine in plasma and extracellular fluids.nicotine bound to antibodies cannot cross the blood brain barrier because of its size the vicious circle of gratification for brain receptor activation is broken. the main brands under study are nic vax ta nic and nic qb . 7.7. nicotine electronic devices electronic cigarette heated cigarette pen drives these devices were launched in 2006 and have since been refined by their manufacturers to replace the 826 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 conventional cigarette. the industry of these products insists on seeing them as smoking cessation treatment arguing that smokers by replacing the use of ordinary cigarettes with these devices would reduce the risk of disease by consuming a product with less toxic substances. with this argument they are investing heavily in marketing and phillips morris one of the largest conventional cigarette manufacturers in the world is widely publicizing its strategy to stop producing ordinary cigarettes and replace it with heated cigarettes also an electronic nicotine release device without combustion.291 the marketing importation and advertising of any electronic smoking device including electronic cigarette and heated cigarette have been banned by anvisa national health surveillance agency since 2009 in brazil rdc 46 . the agency considers that there is no scientific evidence to aid smoking cessation meaning cessation as a treatment process for nicotine addiction or scientific arguments that actually prove reduced morbidity and mortality by tobacco related diseases in populations that have replaced tobacco use. although they contain less toxic substances than conventional non combustion cigarettes those present are not harmless and nicotine is a substance known to have cv effects and perpetuates the addiction condition.292 the impact of the use of these products on people s health is not yet known and although manufacturers are betting on their use as a harm reduction policy the concern is that there is an epidemic of consumption and a setback in encouraging smoking cessation worldwide. therefore who does not recognize these devices as a treatment for smoking and warns that they cause nicotine addiction just as much as regular cigarettes and looks forward to studies evaluating the impact of these products on morbidity and mortality.293 7.8. hookah contrary to popular belief that hookah is less harmful and less addictive than cigarettes research shows that both carry significant health risks and may induce nicotine addiction.294 295 the world panorama shows that the trends of hookah use are alarming and have shifted from being a social phenomenon among young people in some regions to becoming the beginning of a global epidemic.296 in brazil the frequency of hookah use in the brazilian adult population aged 18 to 59 years was determined in a population based cross sectional study using the 2013 national health survey pns . of the 60 225 adults interviewed 15 reported using any tobacco use with the frequency of hookah use being 1.2 95 confidence interval 0.8 1.6 higher in the male white and younger age groups with medium to high schooling and urban and southern and midwestern residents among those who tried hookah 50 used it sporadically 12.8 monthly 27.3 weekly and 6.8 daily. these results point to the need for supervision and educational campaigns on the risks of hookah use.297 7.9. conclusion pharmacological treatment of smoking should be considered as a secondary prevention strategy mainly aimed at reducing cv injury. smoking is a chronic degenerative disease and should be viewed by the cardiologist like the other common illnesses in their care routine such as hypertension and dm. defining criteria for choosing which anti smoking drug will initially be used for patient treatment is still a challenge for treatment guides and guidelines because of the lack of systematization of models to be tested. in clinical practice the choice of drugs is made on the basis of contraindications drug availability and price among other criteria. therefore systematically discussing criterion models for this choice becomes relevant and necessary for increasing the efficacy of anti smoking treatment. the high degree of nicotine dependence298 could be a factor in decision making as well as factors that identify subpopulations that benefit from any particular drug considering gender age pharmacogenetics299 genetic polymorphism of nicotinic dopamine and hepatic receptors among others. these factors are not yet known at this time. recommendations

physical inactivity which is strongly related to all cause and cvd mortality is highly prevalent in brazil and worldwide.301 302 increased physical activity is related to health gain better quality of life and greater life expectancy.303 307 therefore both in an individual and population based cvd prevention strategy it is of utmost importance to prioritize a strong fight against sedentarism and requiring the questioning of pa habits and encouragement of adopting a more active lifestyle should be routinely done at medical office visits.308 8.2. relevant concepts and expressions in physical activity pa is used as a broad term that includes both structured and unstructured forms of leisure sports transportation and domestic and work related activities. physical activity involves body movement with increased energy expenditure in relation to rest and can be classified in terms of intensity as mild moderate or high. physical exercise is defined as a subset of structured activities aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness balance flexibility strength and or power and even cognitive function particularly important in the elderly.309 thus physical activity physical exercise and sports are related but distinct terms and table 8.1 defines some concepts and expressions. there is a strong association of different levels of physical fitness components with all cause mortality and the occurrence of unfavorable cv events with inverse association i.e. the lower the physical fitness the higher the mortality 310 317 requiring preventive action focusing on combating physical inactivity as of childhood. who recently presented specific recommendations for children 0 to 5 years of age related to daily physical activity exercise and sleep times which considerably limits or restricts sitting time in front of screens.318 table 8.2 presents a classification of the profile of children and adolescents according to physical exercise.319 8.3. main acute and chronic effects of exercise the effects of exercise can be divided into acute and chronic.320 the acute effect is that which dissipates rapidly and may be immediate after a single session or last for up to 24 hours subacute or late acute effect . improvement in flow mediated response with respect to endothelial function is an example of the acute effect of a single exercise session. the chronic effect is achieved by repeated acute subacute effects and can be evaluated at rest even if long after the last exercise session. resting bradycardia observed in athletes of predominantly aerobic modalities is an example of chronic effect. repetition of responses can produce a chronic effect as in the case of decreased blood pressure. some of the main effects of exercise are listed in chart 8.1. 8.4. epidemiological rationale of the benefits of physical exercise in addition to aerobic fitness 312 315 321 322 other components of physical fitness are associated with prognosis with higher mortality associated with poor fitness. proven as a predictor of mortality in middle aged and elderly men and women.311 323 other studies on muscle strength and power have also shown associations with mortality.316 317 scientific findings support the previous recommendations of national324 328 and international guidelines329 that recommend the regular and combined practice of aerobic and resistance exercises. flexibility and balance exercises should be part of an exercise program especially aimed at the elderly. regarding pe the greatest benefit is when comparing sedentary individuals and those who engage in very little or no exercise since the positive impact of abandoning a sedentary lifestyle is very significant. however comparing the varying degrees of aerobic fitness on an increasing scale we realize that there is a continuous decrease in the risk of cardiac death 829 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 table 8.2 childhood and adolescence profile according to physical exercise adapted from balassiano et al. 319 score definition childhood adolescence 0 sedentary or very inactive sometimes riding a bicycle often dismissed from physical education at school. 1 little active normal frequency in school physical education and short and intermittent periods of sports or dancing. 2 moderately active regular participation most of the time in physical activity classes or sports activities or dance or fighting academies. 3 very active regular and frequent participation in various sports activities on most days of the week. 4 very active and competitive participation most of the time in training and or sports competition or regular and frequent practice of predominantly aerobic exercise. table 8.1 main concepts and terms in the subject exercise sedentarism and health concepts and terms significance physical aptitude ability to perform activities and physical exercises expected for their age group gender and body which promote health survival and adequate functionality in the environment in which they live. it is divided into aerobic and non aerobic components muscle strength power flexibility balance and body composition . physical activity any body movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. physical exercise structured and repetitive physical activity for the purpose of maintaining or optimizing physical fitness body aesthetics and health. sport physical exercises with variable energy demand involving rules and competitions and aimed at individual or collective winning. sedentarism it is a condition in which there is no regular exercise or frequent physical activity involving energy expenditure 2 to 3 times that at rest at work personal transportation or leisure. exerciser one who works out regularly. athlete one who simultaneously meets the following criteria a training in sports to improve performance b actively participating in sports competitions c being formally registered in sports organizations and d having sports training and competition as their focus of interest or way of life. and all cause death. the higher aerobic fitness the lower the risk is of total morbidity and mortality and cvd both in healthy individuals and in cvd patients.312 315 321 322 greater physical fitness and amount of physical activity are associated with lower risk of developing hypertension.330 in already hypertensive individuals pe reduces bp and better results have been found with aerobic exercise mean sbp reduction of 8.3 mmhg and dbp 5.2 mmhg . smaller but significant reductions also occur with dynamic resistance training.150 another useful and clinically safe strategy for bp reduction is based on manual isometric training.150 331 in patients with resistant hypertension those with over target bp despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications exercise in warm water 30 to 32 c resulted in a more marked reduction in bp and should be considered when available.332 334 the effects of reducing blood pressure levels during exercise occur immediately after the end of exercise and last up to 24 to 48 hours. thus as with drugs this action in the cv system needs to be repeated periodically for the benefit to be chronically maintained. regular pe exerts a hypotensive action which adds to the effects of pharmacotherapy335 and may in some cases require reduction of medication doses. it has also been suggested that dyslipidemic individuals with higher cardiorespiratory fitness even without statin use have a lower cvd risk than those with poor fitness using medication. those with higher aerobic fitness and statin use have lower all cause mortality which reinforces the importance of physical exercise and greater physical fitness even in patients with optimized drug treatment.336 337 8.5. risks of physical activity physical exercise and sport healthy individuals have an extremely low risk of events due to regular exercise. a study of more than 20 000 physicians with an average follow up of 12 years found that the risk was approximately one out of every 1.5 million hours of exercise exposure during and within the first 30 minutes post exercise .338 thus the recommendation to be physically active is quite safe and the fear of exercise related problems should not be a barrier or justification for maintaining a sedentary lifestyle. this message needs to be widely disseminated to the population because the percentage of physically active individuals is very low in our country.339 for further information regarding sport and pre participation assessment it is recommended to read the recent update of the brazilian society of cardiology guidelines for cardiology of sport and exercise.328 8.6. recommendations for exercise and physical activity although a meta analysis has shown that simply stimulating the adoption of a more active lifestyle can increase physical activity levels 340 341 the physician s guidance should be for physical exercise to be in an organized and structured manner. 830 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline

individual assessment can perform exercises at more intense levels aiming at a minimum of 75 minutes ideally divided into two or more weekly sessions. localized muscular endurance and strengthening or power exercises have been shown to be very beneficial for general health and for cv and musculoskeletal systems being of fundamental importance in patients with sarcopenia and or osteopenia. they

physical activity. should be given to the execution of the movements so that technique and posture are correct. there are different protocols for resistance exercise from the number of exercises used per session from 6 to 15 when done daily there is a tendency to work a muscle group on alternate days ranging from one to three sets for each exercise and also in the number of repetitions from 6 to 15. when training muscle power the speed of execution should be as fast as possible in the concentric phase of the movement. in this case only 6 to 8 repetitions per exercise are used requiring only 20 to 30 second interval between each series to allow replenishment of the adenosine triphosphate atp and phosphocreatine stocks needed to perform the next series. this strategy also has the advantage of greatly reducing the time dedicated to resistance exercises which in many situations may represent the difference between adhering to the prescribed exercise program and not. flexibility exercises can offer osteomyoarticular benefits health related quality of life and prevention of falling in the elderly. by contributing to easier and more efficient joint movement they ultimately reduce the demand for oxygen in moving situations and thus benefit the cv system. in these exercises we seek to reach the maximum range of motion reaching the point of slight discomfort and statically held position for 10 to 30 seconds. flexibility exercises should ideally be individualized from specific assessments such as the.349 in general women tend to be more flexible than men and there is a tendency for a progressive loss of flexibility with aging. tends to be proportionally larger in shoulder and trunk movements. depending on the age range clinical conditions and objectives of the exercise program for a given patient other forms of 832 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 exercise may be included in the prescription such as motor coordination and balance exercises not to mention the numerous opportunities generated by more playful forms and exercise socializers such as ballroom dancing and tai chi chuan.351 352 performing assessments of aerobic and non aerobic fitness allows a more individualized prescription of physical exercise aiming to obtain the best results and through risk stratification and search for hidden abnormalities minimize the risks of exercise of any kind or intensity. the initial evaluation consists of anamnesis physical examination and ecg. more detailed assessments should be individualized with exercise testing or maximal exercise cardiopulmonary testing anthropometric assessment muscle strength power and flexibility. in the initial evaluation we can quantify the functional deficit against the desirable as well as set goals to be achieved. it is important to emphasize that even those with low initial levels of physical fitness can benefit from and become adherent to a supervised exercise program.353 it is also possible to obtain clinical and functional support for appropriate counseling on sexual activity based on the kitomi model proposed by brazilian authors in 2016.354 it is essential for commitment to be encouraged in the patient on reevaluation while measuring his her evolution and benefits obtained. 8.8. formal and informal physical activity encouraging referral implementation and adherence although health benefits occur with relatively low intensity activities resulting from informal daily actions such as walking climbing stairs cycling and dancing it is ideal that regular exercise formal activities also occur which provides greater gains. patients with heart disease also benefit from regular physical exercise ideally in the context of a formal cv rehabilitation program or supervised physical exercise . cv rehabilitation acts on major disease outcomes with proven effects by meta analyses of randomized trials reducing cv mortality reducing hospitalizations355 356 and improving quality of life. in addition cv rehabilitation is a cost effective treatment.357 358 a possible way to improve exercise counseling by health professionals would be to combat their physical inactivity as it has been shown that physically active people have greater knowledge about recommendations on prescribed exercises and can motivate more.359 in addition to direct medical practice there is a need for changes in public and private policies with the need for comprehensive strategies established through simultaneous actions such as increasing physical activity in school programs transport policies and systems that favor commuting through walking cycling and public transportation public education including public awareness campaigns sports organization at various levels school work community etc. with proposals that encourage and enable lifelong sports from childhood to old age. 8.9. final messages physical inactivity should be combated by increasing physical activity in its various forms both structured physical and unstructured favoring urban mobility with bicycle paths and facilitating travel through walking. there is a consensus that a good and plausible weekly goal for health promotion and cvd prevention is to engage in physical activity exercise sport for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of high intensity. given the current stage of knowledge it can be said that any amount of physical activity is better than none and sedentarism is a worse possible situation the benefits of exercise seem to be greater with more exercise up to 5 times the minimum recommendation there is no consistent scientific evidence that more than 10 times the minimum recommended exercise is harmful to health there are no longitudinal studies relating heart disease to severe physical exercise when performed regularly in healthy individuals.303 360 9. spirituality and psychosocial factors in cardiovascular medicine 9.1. concepts definitions and rationale 9.1.1. introduction there are lines of evidence that demonstrate a strong relationship between spirituality religion and religiosity and the processes of health illness and healing composing together the physical psychological and social aspects of the integral vision of the human being. in contrast to the easy conceptual assimilation obstacles are observed mainly due to lack of knowledge of the concept and scientific outdating regarding the operationalization of the spirituality construct and the understanding of how to measure and evaluate its influence on health outcomes.361 spirituality and religiosity are valuable resources used by patients to cope with illness and suffering. the process of understanding relevance identifying demands and providing adequate spiritual and religious support benefits both patients the multidisciplinary team and the health system itself. about 80 of the world s population have some religious affiliation and faith has been identified as a powerful mobilizing force in the lives of individuals and communities.362 363 9.1.2. concepts and definitions definitions of spirituality typically merge with other constructs such as religiosity and the dimensions of psychological well being especially positive relationships with other people purpose in life and sometimes paranormal beliefs. conceptual heterogeneity has been widely recognized and for some authors spirituality has no clear definition the term being used inaccurately and inconsistently varying according to religion culture and time and therefore difficult to gauge.364 the meaning of the word religion has latin derivations that refer to rereading from scripture to re binding or even to 833 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 reelection back to a god inferring connections to deity other people or their beliefs and values. although the term religion in the past and in current theological erudition has been used to grasp the institutional and individual dimensions of experience contemporary references to religion increasingly imply institutional social doctrinal and denominational characteristics of lived experiences.361 according to koenig religion is an organized system of beliefs practices and symbols designed to facilitate closeness with the transcendent or the divine and foster understanding of one s relationship and responsibilities with others living in the community .361 363 365 religion is a multidimensional construct that includes beliefs behaviors dogmas rituals and ceremonies that can be practiced in private or public contexts but are somehow derived from established traditions that have developed over time within a community. religion is also designed to facilitate closeness with the transcendent and promote an understanding of one s relationship and responsibility to others when living in a community.365 religiosity is how much an individual believes follows and practices a religion. it can be organizational church temple or religious services or non organizational such as praying reading books or attending religious programs. historically spirituality was considered a process that unfolded within a religious context with institutions designed to facilitate the spiritualization of the practitioner. only recently has spirituality been separated from religion as a distinct construct in part because of the distancing from the authority of religious institutions in modern social life and the increasing emphasis of individualism on western cultures.361 more recently faced with the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care a group of interprofessional specialists in palliative and spiritual care has defined spirituality as a dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity through which people seek meaning purpose and transcendence and experience relationship with self family others community society nature and the meaningful or sacred. spirituality is expressed through beliefs values traditions and practices. 366 according to the study group on spirituality and cardiovascular medicine gemca of the brazilian society of cardiology spirituality is a set of moral mental and emotional values that guide thoughts behaviors and attitudes in the circumstances of intra and interpersonal relationship life. one can also add the aspect of being motivated or not by the will and be subject to observation and measurement http departamentos.cardiol.br gemca . we consider it important that spirituality be valued measurable in all individuals regardless of religious affiliation including atheists agnostics or even those with religious affiliation but without observing and practicing it. for some both atheists and agnostics while not believing or uncertain about god s existence still have a form of spirituality based on existential philosophy finding meaning purpose and fulfillment in their own lives. spirituality evokes concerns compassion and a sense of connection with something greater than us.367 thus spirituality may include religion and other universal views but it encompasses much more general ways in which these experiences are expressed including through the arts relationships with nature and others and for some through the concept of secular humanism. this emphasizing reason scientific inquiry individual freedom and responsibility human values compassion and the needs for tolerance and cooperation. 9.1.3. rationale and mechanisms a significant and growing body of evidence demonstrates an association between spirituality and religiosity and mortality indices quality of life with supposed mechanisms based on a huge range of biological and mediating variables varying according to the model of healthy populations or not . healthy forms of expression of spirituality and religiosity research development scenario etc.365 368 369 in an american cohort predominantly composed of christians 40 years of age and followed for an average of 8.5 years a lower risk of death was observed regardless of confounding factors among those who reported religious services at least once a week compared to no presence. the association was substantially mediated by health behaviors and other risk factors.370 in a 2009 systematic review spirituality religiosity was associated with reduced mortality in studies involving healthy populations but not in trials of the sick population. the protective effect of spirituality and religiosity was independent of behavioral factors such as smoking alcohol exercise socioeconomic status negative affect and social support. when compared to organizational but not non organizational religious activities it was associated with longer survival.371 in the women s health initiative study involving more than 43 000 menopausal women cv risk was highest in patients with private spiritual activity such as prayer bible reading and meditation. subgroup analysis suggests that this association may be determined by the presence of severe chronic diseases.372 it is possible that spirituality and religiosity will have little impact on outcomes once disease is established identified and treated and is more important in promoting resistance to health problems before they reach an advanced stage. it should also be noted that religious coping is often used but may have positive or negative connotations. negative religious coping such as passive acceptance of fatality and requests for direct intercession can be detrimental in contrast to other beneficial effects.371 more recently new cohort studies have made important contributions from the perspective of epidemiology and the associations between religious service mortality and quality of life. in the nurses health study cohort of over 74 000 nurses followed for up to 8 years both all cause mortality and cvd or cancer mortality were reduced by about 30 in women who attended religious services at least once a week compared to those without any participation.373 in this same population attendance at religious services was significantly associated with lower suicide rate.374 similarly the follow up of a large cohort of black american women showed a significant 46 reduction in mortality rate comparing attendance at religious services several times a 834 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 week with no frequency. on the other hand involvement in prayer several times a day religious confrontation or self identification as a very religious spiritual person did not correlate with mortality.375 this interface between spirituality and religiosity and health and illness processes is multifactorial and can in part be attributed to a behavioral self regulation determined by religious affiliation and participation with reduced consumption of alcohol tobacco and drugs reduction in the number of partners better transport food and access to health care. emotionally religious communion brings better positive psychology and social support and positive spiritual coping can provide more hope forgiveness comfort love and other benefits. in addition to behavioral aspects most studies demonstrate the beneficial relationship between spirituality and religiosity and the physiological and pathophysiological variables of many clinical entities including cvd. despite the great heterogeneity between studies better bp levels neurohormones and autonomic nervous system activation hr variability dyslipidemia cv risk atherosclerotic disease dm crp and other markers of inflammation and immunity have been observed.365 368 another way of understanding the scope spirituality and religiosity may have on clinically relevant outcomes including greater longevity is expressed in the direct relationship with telomere size in leukocytes.376 377 9.2. spiritual history and scales for measuring religiosity and spirituality the degree of spirituality and religiosity of patients can be assessed in spiritual history or anamnesis understood as the set of questions asked to the patient to share their spiritual and religious values to identify possible spiritual issues that may contribute to or undermine the therapy as well as feelings that are used in daily life in the life of relationship whether positive edifying or negative not edifying . it should always be patient centered and guided by what it expresses about its spirituality.378 at first spiritual anamnesis as an integral part of clinical history should be obtained from all patients seeking medical attention but especially those hospitalized with serious chronic progressive or debilitating illness. 9.2.1. why address spirituality and religiosity the approach to the subject is very important because many patients are religious or spiritual and their beliefs influence how to cope with adverse situations in life and may help to cope with the disease. during periods of hospitalization or chronic illness they are often removed from their communities and prevented from practicing their religious beliefs. in addition personal beliefs may affect health related decisions that may be conflicting with treatment.379 380 many health professionals do not know if patients wish agree with or are open to this approach. studies show that most patients would like their doctors to ask about spirituality and religiosity generating more empathy and trust in the doctor and thus rescuing the doctor patient relationship with a more humane care.381 382 9.2.2. objectives of spirituality and religiosity assessment it is essential to seek to understand the patients beliefs identify aspects that interfere with health care evaluate the individual family or social spiritual strength that will allow them to cope with the disease offer empathy and support help them to find acceptance of the disease and identify situations of conflict or spiritual suffering that will require evaluation by a skilled professional.383 384 in this evaluation it is essential to detect negative feelings that may contribute to the illness or aggravation of the condition such as hurt resentment unforgiveness ingratitude among others. 9.2.3. how to address patient spirituality and religiosity there are several ways to approach this issue and most importantly it should be done sensitively without promoting religion or prescribing prayers or religious practices. nor should the individual be coerced into adopting specific beliefs or practices. most of the time the approach can be taken naturally during the interview as the doctor assesses psychosocial aspects.365 patients should be asked about the importance of spirituality religiosity and religion to them if this helps to cope with illness generates stress or negative feelings guilt punishment etc. or influences treatment adherence or decisions and if there are any unmet spiritual needs. the health professional should be sensitive and welcoming to religious beliefs and practices. if there are negative feelings conflicts or spiritual needs the provider should solicit the participation of a trained individual or member of the patient s community to properly address these issues. in the case of nonreligious patients or those who refuse to talk about the subject the doctor may inquire about the ways in which individuals live with the disease what promotes purpose and meaning for their life family friends hobby etc. and what beliefs may have an impact on their treatment. for this approach to be non conflictive preparation and acceptance by both health professionals and patients is required. 9.2.4. scales and instruments for evaluating spirituality and religiosity measuring spirituality and religiosity in clinical practice and research is challenging given the complexity of the elements and definitions involved in denomination beliefs religious spiritual practices participation in religious communities support in dealing with illness forgiveness gratitude altruism spiritual well being pain or suffering and others. the various psychometric instruments can be divided into tools for spiritual tracking or for spiritual history collection.386 387 1. spiritual tracking evaluate the presence of spiritual needs that indicate deeper assessment. they are brief and easy to apply. some of the instruments for spiritual tracking are listed in chart 9.1. spiritual tracking provides important information and may indicate the need for further evaluation although aspects remain to be studied better time to apply in different stages of the disease and differences in cultural context among others . 835 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 chart 9.1 instruments spiritual

spiritual history they allow a broader evaluation of the different domains of patients spirituality and religiosity that may affect clinical evolution their attitude towards cvd self care and their physical mental and spiritual well being during the disease. they are well structured instruments addressing the different domains but they should be applied informally from memory throughout the conversation with the patient which serve as a tool or guide and should not be viewed rigidly but as continuous learning and consequent familiarization with the task of completing the anamnesis. there are several validated instruments for collecting spiritual history whether to evaluate spirituality and religiosity more broadly or for research purposes. 2. a. religiosity scales the religiosity index durel duke university religion index is a scale of five items that measure three dimensions of religious involvement 1 assesses organizational religiosity or 2 assesses non organizational religiosity nor and 3 4 and 5 consider the assessment of intrinsic religiosity ir chart 9.2 . validated in brazil 392 durel is succinct and easy to apply addresses the main domains of religiosity and has been used in various cultures. it has shown good psychometric characteristics face and competitor validity and good test retest reliability but does not evaluate spirituality. the dimensions of religiosity measured by durel have been related to several indicators of social support and health.39 2. b. assessment of spiritual history the assessment of spirituality involves a set of questions about its different domains that are associated with health outcomes based on previously validated scales. known by acronyms some of the main instruments are fica 393 hope 394 faith380 and spirit.395 among these the fica questionnaire has shown the best psychometric characteristics chart 9.3 . it was created by doctors based on clinical experience and can be used in different clinical situations. it analyzes four dimensions faith or belief importance and influence community and action in treatment has easy application fast execution and good memorization383 similarly hope has shown good performance in spiritual assessment chart 9.3 . studies evaluating the association of spirituality and religiosity with cv outcomes have been criticized for the difficulty in adjusting for multiple comparisons certain seemingly contradictory findings and too many instruments. measuring spirituality is complex because of the many aspects involved in defining it and the multiple domains it encompasses. systematic reviews386 396 397 broadly discuss the tools available for assessing spirituality and religiosity showing that the different instruments measure a wide range of spiritual dimensions including religious denomination attendance at religious ceremonies or nor and ir religious spiritual coping religious and spiritual beliefs practices and values well being and inner peace stress generated by religion struggle a tendency towards forgiveness and gratitude. the scale called brief multidimensional measure of religiousness and spirituality validated in brazil 392 considers in its analyses the frequency of spiritual experiences values beliefs propensity for forgiveness personal religious practices religious and spiritual overcoming religious support and commitment. the

meaning in life wonder wholeness and integration spiritual strength inner peace hope optimism and faith.398 in a systematic review lucchetti et al. 386 selected and evaluated instruments for clinical research validated in portuguese. 9.2.5. attitudes and behaviors after spiritual anamnesis with information on the spiritual dimension of patients it is possible to establish new possibilities for understanding the pathophysiology illness and consequent medical intervention. some general lines can be established 1. take no action religious issues are delicate and not always objective to the point of plausible resolution even though they may be of great importance to the patient. often the best course is simply to offer your empathy and understanding 2. incorporate spirituality in preventive health the physician can encourage the patient to use his her spirituality as a disease prevention tool by engaging in activities such as prayer and meditation 3. include spirituality in adjuvant treatment the physician can help the patient identify spiritual aspects that along with standard treatment may help with the outcome of the disease in the case of serious illness the physician can collect the spiritual history and help the patient find meaning accept the illness and cope with the situation using his her spiritual resources in the best way 4. modify the treatment plan it is up to the physician to understand that the patient has the freedom to be able to modify the therapeutic plan on the basis of religious beliefs and thus to propose modifications in the course of the treatment. for example the patient may opt for meditation as an option for chronic pain change chemotherapy plans and seek community support. 836 updated updated cardiovascular

spirituality and religiosity are associated with lower prevalence of smoking alcohol consumption sedentarism pa better nutritional and pharmacological adherence in dyslipidemia hypertension obesity and dm.365 399 401 alcohol in many studies that examined the relationship between spirituality and religiosity with alcohol use an inverse relationship was found that is there were higher rates of spirituality or frequency of religious activity with lower alcohol consumption. according to the same authors several studies have shown that more religious individuals are more physically active. there is also a positive relationship between spirituality and religiosity and pa.365 among brazilian university students a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption smoking and use of at least one illicit drug in the last 30 days among those who had less frequent religious involvement.399 smoking in the cardia cohort study it was observed that religiosity was related to lower risk of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and had a positive association with higher consumption of fiber vegetables and fruits and lower consumption of processed foods.401 402 obesity in both the mesa and cardia studies a higher association was observed between extent of religious involvement and higher propensity for obesity.401 402 compared to those who did not participate in any religious activity individuals with different frequencies of religious involvement were significantly more prone to obesity even after adjusting for demographic and smoking characteristics. diabetes mellitus regarding diabetes although they are more prone to obesity patients with greater religiosity had no higher risk of being diabetic. this may be explained by better diet or better treatment adherence.366 in contrast in the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii study there was no association between diabetes and attendance at religious services.370 hypertension regarding hypertension the results are contradictory. in the chicago community adult health study it was found that higher religiosity indicators were not associated with hypertension.403 in the prospective black women s health study after an 8 year follow up the greater involvement with spirituality and religiosity employed in coping with stressful events was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension especially in women with higher stress.404 a national study involving a highly religious community found that the prevalence of hypertension among these individuals was lower than the national prevalence.405 meditation is one of the most studied interventions among practices related to spirituality and religiosity and the repercussions on bp levels. in these studies the magnitude of bp reduction varies significantly. studies have methodological limitations with data bias high dropout rates and different populations studied. in a systematic literature review transcendental meditation reduced sbp by 4 mmhg and dbp by 2 mmhg effects comparable to other lifestyle interventions such as weight loss and exercise.407 the mechanisms by which meditation reduces pa have not yet been fully elucidated. possibly the long term neurophysiological changes that occur with meditation may lead to changes mediated by the autonomic nervous system in bp. the impact of stress reduction on bp remains to be better defined.406 9.4. secondary prevention as with primary prevention secondary prevention should be viewed as comprehensive and taking into account psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status depression anxiety hostility anger and type d personality that may aggravate cvd.2 in this context some of these factors should be highlighted as well as the results obtained with new proposals for intervention in the field of spirituality religiosity and related areas. forgiveness evaluated by various scales as tendency and attitude forgiveness determines multiple effects generating states more favorable to homeostasis in the emotional cognitive physiological psychological and spiritual aspects. forgiveness broadens the possibilities for behavior by building better adaptive strategies and counteracting the feelings of anxiety anger and hostility that are potent cv risk factors. it also reduces stress drug addiction and rumination improves social support interpersonal relationships and health self care.409 413 one study analyzed the effect of forgiveness on myocardial ischemia ischemia generated by stress and measured by scintigraphy techniques. patients were randomized to receive or not a series of psychotherapy sessions to develop interpersonal forgiveness. after 10 weeks of follow up the forgiveness intervention was able to reduce the burden of anger induced myocardial ischemia in patients with cad.414 gratitude in clinical practice gratitude can be assessed by specific questionnaires such as the gratitude questionnaire 6 gq 6 415 allowing the analysis of behavioral interactions and physiological pathophysiological and clinical outcomes. individuals with greater gratitude have a better cv health profile similarly to those with higher spirituality and religiosity indices. in asymptomatic hf patients assessed by the gratitude depression sleep gratitude and spiritual well being questionnaires the latter two correlated with better inflammatory profile and better mood and sleep quality less fatigue and greater self efficacy.416 psychological strategies that may increase feelings of gratitude such as regular journaling thoughts meditation and fact checking or grateful people have been studied demonstrating increased feelings of gratitude and reduced inflammatory markers.417 depression and resilience depression is significantly more common in patients with cvd than in the general community. this higher prevalence is often secondary to the disease as an adaptation disorder with symptoms disappearing spontaneously in most patients. however approximately 15 of them develop a major depressive disorder which is an independent risk marker of increased morbidity and mortality.418 419 in a cross sectional study including 133 patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease assessed by the wagnild young resilience scale 81 were classified as 838 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 resilient suggesting that disease may act as a facilitator for the presence of this feeling.420 resilience is a behavior that greatly improves treatment adherence as well as quality of life and can be acquired at any stage of life regardless of age and disease state. spirituality and religiosity are associated with higher levels of resilience.420 421 in another series elderly patients 65 years were significantly more resilient than younger patients. resilience correlated negatively with depression and inversely with affective cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression and was responsible for greater variation in the affective characteristics of depression than in the somatic characteristics.419 in a long term cohort patients were analyzed for functional social support bmi recent history of major depression coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes. after 13 years it was observed that social support was responsible for reducing the relationship between depression and the occurrence of coronary artery disease. specifically depression was prospectively associated with coronary artery disease among individuals with low social support but not those with high support suggesting that it may function as a resilience factor against cv risk associated with depression.422 the palliative care in heart failure study was the first randomized controlled trial involving palliative care to demonstrate the significant clinical benefit of incorporating interdisciplinary interventions in the management of patients with advanced hf. the addition of palliative care improved physical and psychosocial condition anxiety depression and spiritual quality of life.423 relaxation and meditation relaxation and meditation are well established mind body approaches to improving stress and their benefit has been demonstrated in many populations including heart disease.344.424 426 easy to learn and practical they are inexpensive and widely accessible techniques. in an observational study in patients with coronary artery disease the cardiac rehabilitation strategy associated with a 13 week program was analyzed using self relaxation spiritual well being and psychological stress control techniques. there were significant increases in relaxation practice time and spiritual well being scores as well as improvement in depression anxiety hostility and overall severity scores. a greater increase in relaxation practice time was associated with spiritual well being which in turn was associated with improved psychological outcomes.424 patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled in a transcendental meditation or health education program with an average follow up of 5.4 years. transcendental meditation significantly reduced the risk of mortality myocardial infarction and stroke these changes being associated with lower bp levels and

cardiopulmonary test and improved quality of life assessed by the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire.426 a recent paper by the american heart association reviews various forms of meditation and highlights the prolonged effects observed on brain physiology and anatomy possibly responsible for better systemic physiological status and reduced cardiovascular risk. meditation shows a better physiological response to stress smoking cessation reduced bp insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome endothelial function inducible myocardial ischemia and primary and secondary prevention of cvd. although some data on cvd risk reduction are limited meditation can be considered as a complement to risk reduction and lifestyle modification.344 in a robust study involving 1 120 meditators other complex domains have been identified that may be crucial to people s psychological and spiritual development by acting as mediators and or mechanisms responsible for the effects of meditation. of difficult measurement relational and transpersonal aspects mystics and anomalous or extraordinary phenomena linked to meditation deserve further study. the extent of the possible effects to be obtained with each form of meditation remains open. transcendental meditation has been shown to reduce anxiety improve mood and to double the acute pain tolerance time when compared to secular forms of meditation.428 medication adherence in a cohort of 130 hf patients adequate adherence score was observed in only 38.5 of patients. spirituality religiosity and personal beliefs were the only variables consistently associated with adherence. it is noteworthy that depression or religiosity were not correlated with adherence when evaluated separately. when spirituality was assessed by both it was positively correlated with adherence adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and psychosocial instruments.429 cardiac rehabilitation several studies report improvement in psychological stress in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing cv rehabilitation. in addition a meta analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 3 180 coronary artery disease patients seeking to assess the impact of adding psychosocial interventions to standard rehabilitation exercise reported greater reduction in psychological distress and improvements in sbp and serum cholesterol.430 the scope of cardiac rehabilitation can be amplified by positive psychology techniques. in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty these explanatory techniques with telephone contacts and inductive correspondence resulted in better physical performance caloric expenditure with a reduction in medical events as opposed to the effects observed by stress.431 in another meta analysis the influence of rehabilitation associated with psychosocial and or educational interventions in 14 486 individuals with pre established coronary artery disease with a median follow up of 12 months was evaluated. in general rehabilitation led to a reduction in cvd mortality and the risk of hospitalizations and a better quality of life.354 9.5. recommendations for clinical practice most patients and their families guardians or caregivers have varying degrees of religiosity and spiritual needs and importantly expect health professionals to know their beliefs and to be part of the decision making process reinforcing the concept of integrality. 839 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 health professionals involved should keep in mind that spirituality and religiosity favorably influence ability to cope with the disease but the isolation imposed by hospitalization may be negative as it removes patients from their religious meetings or practices from religious leaders and of dedicated communities. these beliefs and practices can impact and often antagonize proposed medical strategies. it is worth noting that health professionals also present their own profiles of spirituality and religiosity influencing their practice especially in severe critical or limiting situations. every professional should be aware of the relevance of screening involving spirituality and those focused on direct care such as doctors nurses and chaplains should have an anamnesis of spirituality and religiosity viewed not only as part of identifying where professed religion is concerned but how a broader construction obtained by structured or unstructured questionnaires allowing to penetrate and understand the true identity of spirituality and religiosity in patients and relatives.387 432 433 most professionals are sensitive to the demand of patients only when informed but the contemporary view is to actively search for this information and demands because the patient often does not feel comfortable discussing it.432 in a holistic view of a human being the anamnesis of spirituality and religiosity should be remembered in each care interaction and by all health professionals.366 433 naturally this approach may be unimportant or difficult to use in many situations such as in major emergencies but it is of enormous relevance in critical terminal chronic degenerative diseases or palliative care. critically ill patients have high rates of not only pain dyspnea anorexia and fatigue but also of anxiety nervousness sadness and depression. for this patient profile cicely saunders concept of total pain understood as a sum of physical psychological social emotional and spiritual elements must be valued and addressed in a systematic and structured manner even in the first days of hospitalization.434 435 patient centered approaches with a greater focus on spirituality make it easy to understand and value the motivations for consultation understand the patient s universe including emotional and existential issues and strengthen the relationship between practitioners and patients shared decision making and prevention and promotion of health.433 436 it is essential for professionals to be technically prepared and the patient to agree on addressing issues related to spirituality and religiosity so that the interaction is constructive and without conflict. in the absence of technical training or resistance to the subject by the patient the spiritual history should be postponed to a more opportune time or even canceled. when these alignments do not occur serious conflicts can develop and sometimes very deleterious to medical management. to avoid conflicts in the doctor patient relationship it should always be borne in mind that this area is deeply personal as well as intensely emotional and therefore the physician should not address emotional issues without proper approximation of spiritual and or religious aspects. the physician should be sure of the patient s agreement to address the issue. health professionals especially those involved in critical or terminal patient care or palliative care are subject to a significant burden of professional stress. this work involves a lot of compassion understood as an attitude of addressing the needs of others and helping those in distress which can be viewed as a spiritual practice. training and practice strategies on spirituality and religiosity in this setting can contribute to a better sense of meaning and purpose at work spiritual well being less fatigue and reduced burnout.366 the reasons for professionals not addressing spirituality and religiosity are diverse such as feeling uncertain about initiating spiritual discussions being misunderstood as imposing religion invasion of privacy causing discomfort difficulties with the language of spirituality.436 these justifications have also been identified in brazilian medical students437 and represent weaknesses in medical education and practice with specific ignorance or inadequate dimensioning lack of mastery of specific tools and training. the solution to these limitations lies in the development of hospital spirituality support and training programs. these programs contribute to well being and health improvement assist with misunderstanding in conducts and meet patients expectations and they are part of accreditation processes and prospects for reducing hospitalization costs.438 for the development of these programs there should be deep institutional involvement formal training of the teams most directly connected to care availability of infrastructure and resources adjustments to care routines and alignment with the various religious communities. health teams especially when acting in scenarios where there is a higher demand for spirituality and religiosity should be structured with systematic training and clear definition of responsibilities such as obtaining and recording anamnesis in medical records clarifying the observed demands and the implemented clinical course as well as the observed outcomes. at initial contact spiritual history can be obtained through open and brief questions by the doctor nurse or chaplain thus tracking needs and anticipating conflicts. for the spiritual approach no professional is expected to be able to do so but a certified chaplain or a spiritual care professional with equivalent technical training and structured standards and concepts to develop a spiritual care plan.387 religion should never be prescribed forced or even encouraged at the risk of adding guilt to the burden of disease. identifying the right time for spirituality and religiosity approaches is important to avoid any kind of misunderstanding always under the rule of common sense. we emphasize that the evaluation of spirituality is always desirable enabling the search for information in all patients regardless of religion or religiosity but the approach in extreme situations can lead to stress and even worsen patient evolution. respect for spirituality religiosity and individual beliefs is essential and should match the therapeutic plan if it is not harmful. if necessary and at the patient s wishes and in the face of risk or harm or in conflict situations the presence of religious 840 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 representatives or leaders can bring comfort balance and better management and can contribute to a desired consensus. the approach of spirituality and religiosity topics in medical consultation in an area such as cardiology where the patient is generally in a situation of fragility and more sensitive and stressful increases the complexity of the multiple variables already mentioned and may generate some conflicts. the misunderstanding or intolerance of the parties involved are major factors and can generate conflicts of various kinds and at all interfaces involving the patients their families and their relationships within the multidisciplinary team itself and between the team and the patient. all these problems can be prevented by good management of the doctor patient relationship which once consolidated will make all other situations less influential. conflicts can be avoided even for untrained professionals as long as some important steps are followed conduct spiritual anamnesis without prejudice showing deep interest and respect for the patient seeking to understand their religion beliefs and practices 363 encourage questions to help patients clarify their feelings and thoughts about the spiritual perspective of what is going on or even their possible spiritual problems.393 in questions related to spirituality and religiosity it should be kept in mind that it is always better to understand than to advise. concepts involving evidence based medicine have also been applied in the realm of spirituality but the available evidence is not always ideal and definitive. in these scenarios available evidence should be used to improve this practice also contributing to the revision of old concepts the development of new research and the advancement of science in the field of spirituality. in chart 9.4 gemca gathers recommendations that may be useful for improving cardiology practice in our country. chart 9.4 practices in spirituality

the last century humanity has undergone an epidemiological transition in relation to the causes of death infectious diseases are no longer the leading cause of death while chronic degenerative diseases especially cvd now take the lead. although they are still the leading causes of mortality worldwide from the late 1950s a decline in cvd mortality began in industrialized countries. in brazil this decrease in cvd mortality began to be observed in the late 1970s with a significant reduction in these rates despite significant regional differences.2 440 441 it is not possible to only associate the reduction in mortality due to cvd to the better control of classic cv risk factors such as diabetes hypertension obesity dyslipidemia and smoking since all of these except smoking have increased in prevalence in recent decades. this led to new concepts about occupational behavioral and environmental risk factors which are directly influenced by the socioeconomic conditions of the populations and have an important relationship with the causes of mortality. in this chapter we describe important conditions associated with increased cv risk that require concomitant assessment with classic cv risk factors when addressing cvd as a complex relationship between patients and the context in which they live. 10.2. socioeconomic factors and cardiovascular risk the health conditions of populations are influenced in a complex way by social determinants such as income 841 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 distribution wealth and education. these indicators act as interdependent risk factors for disease occurrence. relationships between mortality rates and socioeconomic level have already been evidenced in brazil and other countries showing an inverse relationship i.e. low socioeconomic levels are related to high mortality rates. these relationships between reductions in mortality rates in particular deaths from diseases of the circulatory system dcs and improvement in socioeconomic indicators are highly correlated. several prospective studies have shown that low socioeconomic status defined as low educational level low income low status employment or living in poorer residential areas have contributed to the increase in all causes of death as well as the risk of death from cvd.9 442 446 low socioeconomic status when defined as an independent cv risk factor has been shown to confer an increased risk for cvd with rr mortality between 1.3 and 2.0.445 447 the time periods in which there was a reduction in mortality rates due to diseases of the circulatory system were preceded by periods with improvement in socioeconomic indicators. in brazil between the 1930s and 1980s there was great economic growth that despite the concentration of income enabled educational sanitary economic and infrastructure improvements reducing infectious diseases and inflammatory processes. in developed countries the decline in cvd mortality began a little over a decade after the end of world war ii which followed the great depression of the early 1930s and the 1918 influenza pandemic. the same decline began just over 40 years after the beginning of the period of economic growth. exposure to infectious agents and other unhealthy conditions in the early years of life may make individuals more susceptible to the development of atherothrombogenesis. it is also possible that the reduction in exposure to infectious diseases in the early stages of life is related to the observed decline in adult cv mortality.442 446 448 452 strong correlations have been shown between the human development index falling child mortality rising per capita gross domestic product gdp and the increasing education levels with the reduction in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system in adults from 1980 in some brazilian states and municipalities showing that the improvement in socioeconomic indicators preceded the reduction of cv deaths. the great increase in education over the last decades which practically doubled in the states of rio de janeiro s o paulo and rio grande do sul had a great impact on mortality and is related to the reduction of more than 100 deaths from cvd with a one year increase in average years of study in adults. comprehensive measures to improve socioeconomic indicators should be part of the paradigm for cv disease control. these relationships show the importance of improving the living conditions of the population in order to reduce cv mortality.442 446 448 449 453 454 the assessment of social factors in patients and people with cv risk factors is essential as a means to stratify future preventive efforts with individual s risk profile. recommendations for socioeconomic indicators and cv risk are listed in table 10.1. 10.3. environmental factors and cardiovascular risk atherosclerosis has a complex and multifactorial pathophysiology depending on the integration of several factors inherent to the individual acquired or not with the environment in which he is inserted. the impact of environmental factors on the epidemiology of cv disease has been increasingly studied and recognized especially in relation to the possibility of adopting preventive strategies. in this context in addition to the influence of socioeconomic factors such as income and education the characteristics of the individual s own habitat and lifestyle are also considered. thus the natural and social environments are two different types that potentially influence cv disease.455 the natural environment is determined by specificites of the place where the individual resides such as altitude and latitude density of wooded areas seasons exposure to sunlight and atmospheric temperature. a study by massa et al. 456 in the city of s o paulo in 2010 suggested an inverse relationship between green area density and cv risk regardless of income.456 in addition cvd lethality appears to be higher in winter months while in some places there is an increase of up to 53 in the incidence of ami.457 this increase occurs similarly in young adults 55 years and in elderly 75 years individuals and may be a consequence of both hemodynamic variations. e.g. elevated bp as well as the higher incidence of respiratory infections at this time e.g. influenza which are known to increase the risk of heart attack.455 however elevated temperatures are also associated with a higher cvd risk especially when there is an abrupt variation in temperature.458 the social environment is related to the artificial forms of housing and the characteristic of daily life in modern society especially in the urban environment. population noise level violence access to clean water sanitation and air pollution may limit health promotion and promote the development of infectious and chronic diseases. in this context air pollution was established as the most important modifiable environmental determinant of cvd risk consisting of a complex mixture of gaseous particles and components.459 among such pollutants particulate matter pm is the element that is most relevant to health which is formed by substances whose size and types of particles vary over table 10.1 socioeconomic indicators and cardiovascular risk recommendation recommendation class level of evidence references socioeconomic indicators should be investigated in the clinical assessment and considered in the patient approach to improve the quality of life and prognosis of circulatory system diseases. iib b 483 484 486 488 842 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras

processing agriculture construction and demolition activities forest burning and volcanic eruptions among others.460 thus because of the complexity related to their composition the particles are identified according to their diameter coarse pm or pm10 10 and 2.5 m fine pm or pm2.5 2.5 and 0.1 m ultrathin pm or pm0.1 0.1 m .459 current evidence suggests that pm2.5 is the major pollutant associated with increased cvd risk for both fatal and nonfatal events. the central justification for this relationship is the increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation promoted by the particles. these effects result in the amplification of other traditional risk factors already present and in the potential instability of coronary plaques.461 according to the who the mean daily pm2.5 concentration should be 20 m m3 and the annual 10 m m3. with each 10 m m3 increase in short term exposure there is a 2.5 1 and 2.1 increase in the risks of admission or death from ami stroke and hf respectively. however as exposure tends to occur over several years atherosclerosis becomes progressive and cumulative and also affects regional cv mortality. thus recurrent events may occur even with average annual pm2.5 concentrations below the who targets. other consequences possibly associated with short and long term pollution are venous thromboembolism acute atrial fibrillation hypertension and insulin resistance.459 the recommendations for environmental indicators and cvd risk can be seen in table 10.2. 10.4. vaccination for people with heart disease in most clinical situations vaccination is identified as a primary prevention action. when it is transposed to heart disease it is usually secondary prevention for decompensations that aggravate pre existing cv disease. several vaccines are indicated for adults with priority to patients with ncd such as heart disease. we will list those prescribed for adults with heart disease. there is a specific guideline published by the brazilian society of cardiology regarding indications and doses of vaccines indicated for children and adolescents with heart disease. 10.4.1. prevention of respiratory tract infections in people with heart disease historical reports evidence the seasonal relationship of influenza epidemics with higher mortality among the elderly and patients with ncd. observational trials

elderly and in patients with ncd with a marked reduction in overall mortality hospitalizations myocardial infarction and stroke rates.463 471 venous congestion and immunosuppression present in patients with ncd who are predisposed to infections are highlighted among the pathophysiological explanations. in contrast infections cause changes in coagulation factors platelet aggregation inflammatory response proteins tumor necrosis factor and cytokines and thus may be triggers for acute cv events. infections also play a chronic role in decreasing cardiomyocyte contraction strength inflammation thrombosis fibrin deposition and acceleration of the atherosclerosis process and cardiac remodeling.463 468 471 despite all the evidence and guidelines the rate of vaccination against respiratory infections influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are low in brazil and worldwide.472 474 the overall consensus is for all patients with heart disease and ncds to be vaccinated regardless of age they are summarized in chart 10.1 and table 10.3. if the patient is over 60 the patient will be included in government campaigns according to age group. if the patient is under 60 years of age a referral form is required along with a declaration that there is a clinical indication for vaccination. 10.4.2. which vaccines influenza vaccine in brazil it is up to the ministry of health to determine the composition of the vaccine according to the prevalence of circulating types and strains in recent epidemics. it is an inactivated trivalent or tetravalent vaccine with the latter having a greater immunization spectrum. indications characteristics and restrictions are common to trivalent and tetravalent. vaccination should occur annually in the national campaign which takes place between april and may.475 477 pneumococcal vaccine there are two types of vaccine conjugate and polysaccharide. among the conjugates is pneumo 10 which is intended to prevent serious infections in children under 2 years of age therefore outside the scope of ncds with the exception of congenital heart disease. the other available type which is widely used is the pneumo 23 . this vaccine contains 23 pneumococcal serotypes and is indicated for those older than 60 years and those with clinical conditions which put them at risk for pneumonia including those with ncd. conjugate vaccines have shown better performance in clinical work but are not always available in the public network. referral for vaccination after confirmation of diagnosis. recommended revaccination time is five years.475 478

to 29 years of age and one dose over 30 years are indicated with an age limit of 49 years. older people and patients with heart disease are susceptible to falls and injuries and therefore the double vaccine is recommended dt diphtheria and tetanus with a booster vaccine every 10 years.475 477 yellow fever there is limited evidence regarding the safety of the yellow fever vaccination in heart disease patients and those over 60 years of age. there are two prospective studies and one report suggesting that serious adverse effects are rare in this age group but much more frequent than in young people. there is limited data available on the relationship between the risk of adverse effects and the presence of previous cvd disease interaction with cvd drugs and the use of the fractional doses currently adopted in brazil. therefore vaccination is recommended for those at risk of exposure to the disease such as the elderly and heart disease patients. the vaccine should be given as a single dose without the need for a booster vaccine.475 477 479 vaccination precautions the use of platelet antiaggregants is not an impediment to the use of intramuscular vaccines thus there is no need for suspension. subcutaneous vaccination can be performed in patients taking warfarin anticoagulation or direct anticoagulants. there are no reports of clinically significant interactions of vaccination in patients using antihypertensives anti ischemics statins fibrate warfarin or digoxin.475 476 480 481 10.5. lower extremity peripheral artery disease 10.5.1. context the evolution of atheromatous plaque and its association with the various cvd risk factors is widely described in the literature. it is also recognized that the atherosclerotic phenomenon can occur in different vascular beds of larger or smaller caliber. the term peripheral arterial disease pad has been used to characterize atherosclerotic disease that affects several peripheral non coronary vascular beds. in this context the current pad guidelines deal with the theme in different ways. while the european directive 482 has chosen to analyze pad in various vascular territories i.e. carotid subclavian mesenteric renal and lower limb arteries the current american document 483 as well as the society for vascular directive surgery 484 deals exclusively with lower extremity pad. 844 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 more than 200 million people worldwide are estimated to have diverse stages of pad ranging from the asymptomatic phase of the disease to intermittent claudication ic and the more severe late stages of the disease.485 prevalence increases with aging rising by more than 10 in patients aged 60 to 70 years and over 20 in patients over 80 years of age. although the prevalence of symptomatic and more severe forms of pad is higher in men a recent study of 3.6 million individuals in the us has shown that women may be worsening the odds of developing the disease compared to men odds ratio or of 1.62 95 confidence interval between 1.60 1.64 . inversely women were less prone to carotid stenosis or abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa than men.485 486 publications of previous decades already evidenced that the simultaneous presence of pad and cvd or cerebrovascular is frequent especially at older ages. likewise the anatomopathological characteristics and clinical manifestations of cvd in patients with pad are usually more severe with a higher occurrence of multivessel coronary branch injury and a higher prevalence of left coronary trunk injury.487 488 10.5.2. interrelationship between the various cardiovascular risk factors and lower extremity peripheral artery disease in most studies the proportion of symptomatic patients ranges from 20 to 33 among all patients with pad. in the swedish population aged 60 90 years the prevalence of lower extremity pad was 18 and intermittent claudication 7 .489 in brazil a multicenter cross sectional study evaluated 1 170 individuals in 72 urban centers. the prevalence of intermittent claudication was 9 among those with abi below the cutoff point of 0.9. in this analysis women with coronary artery disease were 4.9 times more at risk for lower extremity pad.490 arterial hypertension hypertension increases the chance of lower extremity pad by 32 up to 2.2 times in various epidemiological studies. although the risk of hypertension causing lower extremity pad has been modest in some studies the high prevalence of this risk factor among the elderly reinforces the epidemiological burden of lower limb arteriopathy.489 a comprehensive study of more than 4.2 million individuals in primary health care in the uk investigated the association between hypertension and the risk of lower extremity pad. in this study with each 20 mmhg increase in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive men aged 40 79 years the risk of lower extremity pad increased by 63 . lower extremity pad was associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease ckd hf aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation however it was not associated with hemorrhagic stroke.491 the harmonica project a finnish community based report showed that the prevalence of asymptomatic without claudication lower extremity pad by means of abi was 7.3 in 532 hypertensive subjects compared with 2.3 in 440 normotensive individuals. by adjusting multiple variables hypertension continued to be an independent risk factor associated with lower extremity pad more than tripling the occurrence of lower limb arterial involvement or 3.20 . hypertensive patients with borderline and altered abi represented one third of all participants with hypertension in the average age range of 60 7 years.492 smoking this is a particularly prominent risk factor in atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities. the prospective health professionals follow up study hpfs investigated 44 985 men with lower extremity pad aged 40 to 75 years with a history of limb amputation need for revascularization arterial angiographic injury 50 occlusion and abi below 0 90. the authors followed the attributable risk of four of the most traditional risk factors diabetes hypertension hypercholesterolemia and smoking by a median follow up of 24.2 years. active smoking significantly increased the adjusted risk of lower extremity pad by 12.89 fold 95 confidence interval between 8.59 and 19.34 compared with individuals who had never smoked. also in participants who stopped smoking for more than 20 years the risk of lower extremity pad remained 39 higher than in those who had never smoked.493 the guangzhou biobank cohort study gbcs evaluated the association between second hand smoke exposure and lower extremity pad in non smokers. by adjusting for confounding variables exposure to residential passive smoke for 25 hours week or more was significantly associated lower extremity pad or 7.86 p 0.003 .494 diabetes the presence of diabetes increases the risk of lower extremity pad by 1.9 to 4 times compared to non diabetics.489 in our country the risk of diabetic men developing lower extremity pad was 6.6 times higher than that of non diabetics.490 a case control trial in patients with diabetic foot investigated ulcers that progressed to amputation. after adjusting several variables at least three widely known risk factors were predictors of amputation risk i. hba1c level 8 p 0.002 ii. hypertriglyceridemia p 0.004 and iii. hypertension p 0.028 .495 the risk of lower extremity pad tends to increase with the duration and evolution of both metabolic factors diabetes p 0.001 and hypercholesterolemia p 0.05 over time.493 dyslipidemia hypercholesterolaemia increases the risk of developing lower extremity pad by 90 p 0.05 .493 fh is an autosomal dominant condition associated with mutations in the ldl receptor encoding gene or apob and pcsk c coding genes.9 in a brazilian cross sectional study 202 patients with heterozygous fh were compared to 524 normolipidemic controls. the prevalence of lower extremity pad in the fh group went from 17.3 to 2.3 in the group with appropriate lipid profile p 0.001 .496 classic risk factors continue to play a relevant role when lower extremity pad progresses to more severe forms of vascular impairment such as critical lower limb ischemia cli or acute limb ischemia. such presentations of lower extremity pad have a poor prognosis in terms of disability and death. the uk based prospective population based oxford vascular study oxvasc analyzed the incidence of severe peripheral ischemic outcomes in 92 728 patients. compared with the control population the

preventive approach to lower extremity pad risk factors are equally applicable both regarding the asymptomatic and symptomatic intermittent claudication form of the disease.484 the items listed below and in particular chart 10.3 summarize the risk factors and proposed treatment approaches including recommendation class level of evidence according to the latest international guidelines for lower extremity pad i. smoking cessation is recommended for people with lower extremity pad.482 484 ii. physical exercise in patients with claudication due to lower extremity pad a supervised exercise program is recommended to improve functional performance and quality of life.482 484 the comprehensive review by olin et al. 501 highlights that the methodology of supervised exercise either home or community based has improved considerably over the past decade. iii. antiplatelet despite the small sample size n 366 the clips study showed the benefit of asa in preventing 52 of vascular events such

but it has been relevant as a hypothesis and has reinforced the importance of further investigation on the possible role of new oral anticoagulants in the prevention of vascular events in symptomatic lower extremity pad. vi. antihypertensives in hypertensive patients with lower extremity pad strict bp control below 140 90 mmhg with first choice drugs is recommended. vii. renin angiotensin

severity such as critical lower limb ischemia.482 483 484 the objective is to reduce ischemic events in the lower extremities.483 in addition to their efficacy in glycemic control new hypoglycemic drugs have been required to demonstrate cv safety. in the empa reg study the sglt 2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of cv death by 38 . a recent subanalysis of this study showed that in patients with lower extremity pad at the start of the trial the risk of lower limb amputation in the empagliflozin group was not significantly different from placebo hr 0.84 95 confidence interval

pad evidence levels according to the latest international peripheral artery disease guidelines are listed in chart 10.3. 10.6. autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular risk several autoimmune diseases can affect the heart through various manifestations including arrhythmias pericardial myocardial and coronary artery diseases. in relation to this last complication advances and research in the field of atherosclerosis have increasingly reinforced the participation of the immune system in its pathophysiology. the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages within atheromatous plaques suggests that inflammation is a major factor in the disease evolution cascade. this hypothesis even motivated a recent clinical trial that evaluated the effect of low dose methotrexate on the reduction of cv events in patients without autoimmune diseases but with previous infarction. although the reduction in the primary outcome was not achieved in this study further work in this area is still ongoing. however in patients with rheumatic diseases the systemic inflammatory process is amplified and which may result in the occurrence of accelerated atherosclerosis.509 this condition may be the main explanation for the high percentages of morbidity and mortality in these patients.510 in addition the use of certain immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids may also contribute to the worsening of the cv risk profile. it is worth mentioning ra and systemic lupus erythematosus sle among the diseases that may have this pathophysiological feature although other conditions such as scleroderma inflammatory bowel diseases psoriasis and certain primary vasculitis such as polyangeitis granulomatosis are also relevant.509 511 ra is associated with a 3 fold reduction in survival with ischemic heart disease accounting for about 40 of deaths.512 in addition the risk of ami is about 2 times higher than in the general population and the prognosis after the event tends to be worse. this scenario begins to develop at the onset of the disease and independently of other factors classically associated with atherosclerosis. vascular inflammation caused by autoimmunity seems to play a more important role in this context. some population studies even suggest a recent reduction in cv lethality in these patients perhaps due to the greater availability of disease specific treatments.513 nevertheless functional limitation and consequent physical inactivity imposed by ra may also increase the likelihood of developing other risk factors such as obesity hypertension and diabetes. on the other hand it is noteworthy that systemic inflammation in individuals with ra can reduce serum levels of total cholesterol and ldl promoting what is known as the lipid paradox since the risk of events remains high even with this metabolic profile.513 514 nevertheless control of traditional risk factors remains the main strategy for preventing cv events in these patients. like ra sle also behaves as an independent risk factor for cv disease with a coronary disease prevalence of up to 10 and a risk of events up to 8 times higher than the general population. some studies suggest that ami may be the cause of death in up to 25 of cases especially in patients who have the disease for longer.509 at the same time the prevalence of major cv risk factors such as hypertension diabetes obesity physical inactivity and dyslipidemia is also higher in individuals with sle. frequent use of corticosteroids for disease management is another condition that worsens the metabolic profile although daily doses of prednisone below 10 mg appear to be safe in this respect as do antimalarial drugs.515 nevertheless risk calculators using traditional factors often underestimate the incidence of events in these patients. other markers associated with atherosclerosis that are more relevant in individuals with sle such as osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are promising predictors that could refine this estimate. the fact that disease associated coronary artery disease is more often associated with atherosclerosis than vasculitis corroborates this expectation.516 as most autoimmune diseases are more common among women a thorough stratification of cv risk in females is essential in the presence of these conditions despite the limitations already mentioned. even so the fundamental issue is the absence of clinical studies demonstrating a benefit in treating this group of patients more aggressively. to date there is no evidence that therapeutic targets for blood pressure blood glucose ldl cholesterol or any other risk factor should be modified due to the presence of an autoimmune disease. the relatively low prevalence of these diseases in the population is the main factor limiting good quality studies to answer these questions. therefore each case needs to 847 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891

disease the overall prevalence of ckd is estimated at 11 13 517 and in brazil despite inconsistent data it is estimated that between three and six million people have the disease.518 the relationship between ckd and cvd is complex dynamic and multifactorial. in addition to both sharing risk factors such as systemic arterial hypertension diabetes and advanced age there is a higher prevalence of traditional cvd risk factors in patients with ckd.519 520 in a study by foley et al. 519 with more than 15 000 patients 83.6 of those with estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 and 100 of those with gfr e 30 ml min 1.73 m2 had at least two risk factors for cvd.519 furthermore the loss of renal function itself causes changes that can accelerate cvd such as arterial stiffness and anemia contributing to left ventricular hypertrophy endothelial dysfunction disease chronic inflammation vitamin d deficiency oxidative stress and activation of the renin angiotensin system.520 523 the result of this interaction is that cvd is the leading cause of death in patients with ckd.521 in a meta analysis by van der velde et al. 524 evaluating cohorts of patients with hypertension diabetes or cv disease they observed an increase in all causes of mortality with egfr reduction and rates of 60 45 and 15 ml min 1.73m2 presented a hazard ratio of 1.03 1.38 and table 10.4 autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular risk recommendation recommendation class level of evidence references in the context of preventing cardiovascular events the benefit of using stricter therapeutic targets specifically due to the presence of autoimmune diseases is uncertain iib c 513 514 516 3.11 respectively when compared to patients with egfr 95 ml min 1.73 m2. in addition the presence of albuminuria even when borderline was also associated with higher mortality in this same study and urinary albumin creatinine ratios of 10 mg g 30 mg g and 300 mg g presented a hazard ratio of 1.08 1.38 and 2.16 when compared to the ratio of 5 mg g.524 currently ckd525 and albuminuria are considered independent predictors of cv522 526 events and thus cv prevention plays a key role in the management of ckd patients. overall the risk assessment should be individualized and ckd should be interpreted in the context of the overall risk assessment according to each clinical setting and is considered a high risk cv marker.7 525 given the various clinical scenarios related to ckd it is worth mentioning systemic arterial hypertension dyslipidemia and the use of antiplatelet agents in primary prevention. with regard to systemic arterial hypertension risk stratification and treatment to prevent events and additional loss of renal function should follow the guidelines published by this society.146 it is noteworthy that in this case ckd is used in the additional risk stratification according to egfr and urinary albumin creatinine ratio and can be interpreted as target organ damage egfr 30 60 ml min 1.73 m2 or urinary albumin creatinine 30 300 mg g or as an established disease egfr 30 ml min 1.73 m2 or urinary albumin creatinine 300 mg g . similarly the approach to dyslipidemia in ckd patients should follow the stratification and treatment model proposed in this society s specific guideline.7 in this case ckd egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 is considered as a high risk cv marker for proposed goals and treatments.7 849 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 finally regarding the use of antiplatelet agents in primary prevention the evidence regarding its benefit is not robust enough to indicate its routine use considering ckd alone. in a meta analysis of more than 50 studies and more than 27 000 patients the use of asa reduced the risk of infarction without however reducing overall mortality cv mortality or stroke with increased numbers of major and minor bleeds.527 thus the use of antiplatelet agents should be assessed according to the overall risk and decision making should be made on an individual basis when considering their use solely for ckd. recommendations for ckd and cv risk can be seen in table 10.5. 10.8. obstructive sleep apnea in recent years much has been debated about obstructive sleep apnea osa as a cv risk factor and in 2018 the brazilian society of cardiology published a position on this clinical condition and its implications on cv risk.528 osa is characterized by the temporary narrowing or occlusion of the upper airway during sleep 529 which in turn activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers a chain of events involving elevation of blood pressure release of inflammatory mediators oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction reduced insulin sensitivity and activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.528 530 despite the short duration of events prolonged repetitive exposure to periods of hypoventilation and hypoxemia can lead to chronic changes in metabolism and circulatory system leading to consequences such as systemic arterial hypertension pulmonary hypertension arrhythmias coronary disease stroke heart failure diabetes dyslipidemia and increased mortality cv.528 533 the prevalence of osa has increased in recent years528 529 and some series have reported apnea hypopnea index equal to or greater than 5 events per hour in 34 of men and 17 of women aged 30 to 70.534 in cvd patients the prevalence of osa is higher when compared to patients of the same age and sex in the general population regardless of body mass index.529 among cvd hypertension coronary artery disease stroke and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with reports of associated prevalence of osa of up to 83 58 91 and 53 respectively.528 529 the treatment of osa is mainly based on the use of continuous positive airway pressure cpap . there is evidence that this treatment modality has beneficial effects on blood pressure control 535 but evidence regarding rigid outcomes such as total and cv mortality is not as robust 528 530 with data on primary prevention from observational studies.531 536 in a recent systematic and meta analysis review no reduction in major cv events including vascular death or all cause death was observed.537 it is worth mentioning that in 60 of the studies evaluated cv disease secondary prevention was documented and in such cases with patients undergoing optimal clinical treatment cpap treatment may have little additional effect than current treatment when assessing total mortality and cv outcomes 530 537 despite the benefits of blood pressure control and improvement of extra cardiac symptoms.530 finally cv prevention strategies in osa patients should consider the higher morbidity and mortality attributed to this condition emphasizing the control of other associated risk factors and respecting specific treatment indications according to this society s position on group 11 of aos.528 recommendations for obstructive sleep apnea osa and cv risk are shown in table 10.6. 10.9. erectile dysfunction erectile dysfunction ed is the recurrent inability to obtain and maintain an erection that allows for satisfactory sexual activity. ed is not a disease but a symptomatic manifestation of isolated or associated pathologies.538 it has a prevalence of just over 50 in men over 40 years of age in the usa and brazil. studies have shown a prevalence between 43 and 46 in the same age range.538 541 the causes of ed can be classified as psychological organic or a combination of both. organic factors include vascular endocrine neurological drug related causes and urological interventions. vascular etiology is the most common cause of erectile dysfunction. arterial traumatic disease atherosclerosis and sah are among the main causes of vascular ed. increasing the prevalence in patients with table 10.5 chronic kidney disease ckd and cardiovascular risk

that contribute to the occurrence of ed.542 544 ed is currently recognized as being of vascular etiology in most men with endothelial dysfunction as the common denominator. ed often precedes cvd and is often present in men with known cvd leading to the concept that a man with ed and no cvd symptoms is a patient with cvd until proven otherwise and a man with known cvd should be routinely asked about your erectile dysfunction. ed also has a significant negative impact on the patient and partner one man s problem but a couple s concern thus emphasizing the need to approach ed as early as possible.545 a meta analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies involving 36 744 participants suggested that erectile dysfunction significantly increases the risk of ischemic heart disease stroke and all cause mortality and concluded that it could play a role in quantifying cv risk based on traditional risk factors.546 another population based study of 95 038 men aged 45 and over showed that cvd risk is related to the severity of erectile dysfunction in men with and without established cvd with a relative risk respectively of 1.6 and 1.7 for the development of ischemic heart disease.547 all men with erectile dysfunction should be considered potential candidates for primary prevention cv risk stratification and treated according to their risk estimates. recommendations for autoimmune diseases and cv risk are listed in table 10.7. 10.10. prevention of rheumatic heart disease rheumatic heart disease rhd is the cardiac consequence of acute rheumatic fever arf an inflammatory disease caused by streptococcal pharyngitis. its prevalence is closely related to unfavorable sanitary conditions agglomerations and inadequate access to health systems.548 over the last decades there has been a significant reduction in prevalence and mortality from rhd worldwide with a reduction in standardized global mortality of 47 8 from 1990 to 20152 markedly in developed countries and even near eradication in some regions. however the burden of disease remains high in underdeveloped countries and even in poor regions of developed countries.548 in 2015 the highest age standardized mortality rates for rhd prevalence were observed in oceania south asia and central sub saharan africa but there is clearly an underestimation of data from brazil and latin america partly due to the scarcity of primary data. it is estimated that in 2015 there were 33.4 million cases and approximately 10.5 million disability adjusted life years daly attributable to rhd worldwide.549 the principal determinant of rf is the admittedly repeated infection with group a beta hemolytic streptococci gas and some theories attempt to explain the pathophysiology involved in susceptibility to damage which affects only 6 of individuals exposed to gas a an antigenic similarity between agent structures m protein surface and glcnac epitope and molecules in host tissues triggering an exaggerated immune response and b generation of a neo antigen through contact between gas and collagen matrix subendothelial with consequent binding between m proteins and cb3 region of collagen type iv inducing an autoimmune response against collagen.548 thus primary prevention of rf requires early identification and appropriate therapy for gas pharyngitis. when selecting a treatment regimen consideration should be given to the bacteriological and clinical efficacy ease of adherence to the recommended regimen ie dosing frequency duration of therapy and acceptability cost spectrum of activity of the selected agent and potential adverse effects. in this context intramuscular benzathine penicillin g oral potassium penicillin v and oral amoxicillin are the recommended antimicrobial agents for the treatment of gas pharyngitis in people without penicillin allergy table 10.8 . gas resistance to penicillin has never been documented and penicillin potentially prevents primary attacks of rf even when started nine days after the onset of infection.550 551 in recent decades the long asymptomatic period of rhd and the possibility of early interventions in the subclinical phase have led to the increased role of echocardiography in disease management with the development of population screening studies and the publication of the 2015 revised jones criteria.552 in addition to the incorporation of detected subclinical carditis on echocardiography patients were stratified according to population risk for rhd 552 554 with different criteria for endemic and non endemic regions chart 10.4 . once rhd is diagnosed prevention strategies should focus on preventing recurrences that are associated with worsening or developing rhd. a gas infection does not necessarily have to be symptomatic to trigger a recurrence and rhd can recur even when a symptomatic infection is correctly treated. therefore prevention requires continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis rather than simply recognizing and treating acute episodes of pharyngitis.548 therefore continuous prophylaxis is recommended in patients with well documented history of rhd and in those with evidence of rhd. prophylaxis should be started as soon as rhd or rf is diagnosed. in order to eradicate gas in the oropharynx a complete penicillin cycle should be given to patients with rhd even for those with a negative oropharyngeal culture.548

rheumatic carditis with or without valvular disease are at high risk for recurrence and presumably a progressive risk of more severe cardiac involvement at each episode.555 these patients should receive long term antibiotic prophylaxis until adulthood and in selected cases for life. patients with persistent valvular disease should receive prophylaxis for 10 years after the last episode of rhd or until the age of 40 whichever one is longer. the severity of valvular disease and the potential for day to day gas exposure should be determined and lifetime prophylaxis should be considered in those at high risk e.g permanent contact with children in schools and day care centers care for institutionalized patients work in health facilities etc. .550 551 in non endemic regions administration of benzathine penicillin g every 4 weeks is the recommended regimen for secondary prophylaxis in most situations. in higher risk populations administration every 3 weeks is warranted because serum

the public schools in regions with low socioeconomic indices and primary health care with diagnostic support by telemedicine.556 557 in addition non physician imaging using the whf simplified protocol was effective including the basic identification of changes related to rhd.558 there was a high prevalence of subclinical rhd in low income regions of 4.5 4.0 borderline and 0.5 definitive .556 557 however despite the various cohorts involving these patients the clinical significance and prognostic implication of these findings has not been well established so far. recently a score derived from large population studies in brazil and uganda has been proposed to stratify patients according to the risk of rhd progression based on weights attributed to the echocardiographic variables in the whf criteria.559 however it has also been shown that giving a child a diagnosis of latent rhd can potentially worsen their quality of life and create stigmas 560 which raises important questions about the risk benefit ratio of large screening programs. for these reasons there is no indication for the use of echocardiographic screening outside the research field until further studies on its impact on disease progression are completed. 11. child and adolescence 11.1. introduction childhood and adolescence are the phases with the most potential for the prevention of atherosclerosis. there is robust evidence based on analyzes of the aortas and coronary arteries that atherosclerosis begins at fetal age. however more recent studies show that atherosclerosis may regress in children more easily than in adults since their lesions are less complex and fixed. cvd risk factors respect the tracking phenomenon i.e. a child who has some risk factor will probably have the same factor in adulthood with similar intensity. coupled with the fact that health habits are formed in childhood and adolescence there is a clear need and possibility to prevent atherosclerosis from an early age.561 therefore we will present strategies to control the main habits and risk factors that can be controlled in this age group. recommendation level iia level of evidence b . 11.2. childhood and adolescent nutrition nutrition is the basis of health promotion in childhood and adolescence. in addition eating habits are mainly formed by 7 years of age reinforcing the importance of food education from an early age. population studies show that almost all children ingest larger amounts of poor quality fat and added sugar or lower amounts of fiber than recommended for their age. the following principles are recommended for good child growth and development to prevent atherosclerosis from childhood 562 564 recommendation level iia level of evidence c . 1. exclusive breast milk up to 6 months and introducing other foods up to 2 years old. 2. eating fresh and whole foods from 6 months of age starting with pureed foods and then eating the family diet which should be as healthy as possible. 853 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 3. age appropriate caloric intake taking into account their basal metabolic rate as well as growth and exercise needs except in children with special conditions or inadequate growth and body composition. 4. offer the child the most varied and colorful food possible respecting the proportionality between protein 10 to 20 of total daily caloric volume fat 30 to 40 and carbohydrates 30 to 50 in each age provided there are not any risk factors that require different proportions. 5. encourage the daily intake of fruits and vegetables by offering this type of food at every meal. the child should eat the equivalent of his age 5 in grams of fiber. 6. avoid sugar ideally less than 5 of total daily calories coffee canned goods fried foods soft drinks candies snacks and other treats throughout development these foods should be banned in infants. replace whenever possible processed and ultra processed foods with fresh or minimally processed foods regardless of age and body composition. 7. use salt sparingly. children s food must have a less spice and salt than an adult s 1.2 to 1.5 g day of salt for children up to preschool age and up to 2 g day in school children and adolescents. 8. associate proteins of animal and vegetal origin eat whole grains and vegetables at least 5 times a week in the ratio of 3 1. animal proteins should be of varied origins encouraging the consumption of fish. 9. frequent water intake throughout the day limiting the intake of juices even if natural and without added sugar ideally only provide juices from 1 year of age and at most 120 ml 180 ml and 240 ml for infants preschoolers and schoolchildren respectively. 10. offer high nutritional value fats such as nuts nuts almonds walnuts among others and vegetable oils as long as they are safe avoid fresh nuts in children under 3 years due to the risk of aspiration and according to age appropriate amount. avoid the intake of trans fats as much as possible. for children with dyslipidemia fat intake should be limited to about 25 30 of their total daily calories while maintaining a proportion of 7 to 10 saturated fat and 20 mono and polyunsaturated fat similar to recommendations for adults. the addition of sugar should be avoided and the intake of omega 3 in the form of fish rich in these fatty acids ideally 2 or 3 times a week should be encouraged. follow up with a nutritionist or nutrologist is recommended when there is a risk of malnutrition or impaired growth and development.565 recommendation level iia evidence level a . for children with sah the dash diet should be used as in adults which includes increasing the proportion of fresh foods especially fruits and vegetables and reducing salt intake.566 recommendation level iia level of evidence b . control of the food environment is of utmost importance in childhood and adolescence especially the school environment which should be protected by public policies that encourage the supply of foods with high nutritional value and restrict ultra processed high calorie or high density foods with added sugar and trans fats.567 recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.3. physical activity in childhood and adolescence physical activity is considered an independent protective factor in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease since childhood because of its effect on modulating traditional risk factors and promoting normal endothelial function. higher levels of physical activity are associated with improved bone health nutritional status cardiometabolic health cognitive function and reduced risk of depression.568 intervention programs to increase physical activity in children are associated with improved blood pressure and lipid profile.569 physical activity is considered any body movement that results in energy expenditure. physical exercise consists of planned structured and repetitive physical activity. in brazil the prevalence of physical inactivity was assessed in a sample of 74 589 adolescents in the study of cardiovascular risks in adolescents erica . the prevalence of leisure time physical inactivity reached 54.3 being especially worrying in female adolescents 70.7 . more than a quarter of adolescents reported no leisure time physical activity.570 the discussion about childhood physical activity has two important aspects for cardiovascular prevention. the first is the tracking phenomenon described above highlighting the importance of establishing healthy habits at a time when the child is developing which is much easier to intervene than after the sedentary lifestyle has been established and excessive screen time more than 2 hours day . the second aspect is the accumulation of risk or protective factors over the course of life which can determine different levels of risk over many years of exposure. regarding these concepts in 2016 the american heart association published the cardiovascular health promotion in children document challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond the scientific statement from the american heart association stating that maintaining optimal cv health from birth to young adulthood is critical part of reducing cvd disease in adulthood.571 the physical activity level considered ideal for children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years is 60 minutes or more per day of intense to vigorous aerobic activity. the document also recommends performing muscle strength activity and muscle strengthening and bone loading1 at least three times a week recommendation level iia evidence level b .568 571 preschoolers 3 5 years old should remain active throughout the day to encourage growth development and to acquire a repertoire of motor skills. caregivers should aim to achieve a total of at least 3 active hours per day diversifying from mild to vigorous intensities recommendation level iia level of evidence b . although there is no consensus on the amount of activity or exercise needed to treat cv risk factors such as dyslipidemia hypertension or obesity in childhood it is known that even without effective control of their cv risk physical activity is one of the most important pillars in the prevention of 854 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 atherosclerosis with improvement of endothelial function and even regression of intimal thickening markers of subclinical atherosclerosis.571 572 recommendation level iia level of evidence b . current evidence for adults shows that total activity volume is more important than the duration of each individual session.573 recommendations for all age groups emphasize increasing overall physical activity moving more and reducing sedentary activity avoiding long sitting periods whenever possible. for children this means encouraging outdoor play whenever possible activities with different levels of intensity such as walking the dog storing toys walking to school among others. it also means from a public policy point of view ensuring safe spaces for children and adolescents to play sports or jogging an urban layout that encourages walking or cycling and the structure and availability of qualified physical exercise teachers schools and other community locations such as parks and gyms.568 573 recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.4. smoking in children and adolescence about 18.5 of brazilian adolescents have tried cigarette smoking. smoking increases cv risk in childhood even when it is passive low birth weight higher risk of childhood obesity it also determines endothelial dysfunction as early as childhood in addition to all pulmonary neurological risks.574 575 childhood is the most important phase for smoking prevention as about 90 of people start smoking by age 18. in addition it is an ideal moment for parental smoking cessation as they may change their habits if the harmful effects of secondhand smoke are shown to their children. this intervention should occur in different environments 2 of which may be directly addressed by the physician 576 recommendation level i level of evidence c . at the pediatrician clinic 1. ask about your child s passive exposure to smoking during childcare consultations and in consultations regarding potentially smoking related illnesses. ask about caregiver and environment smoking electronic cigarettes and cannabis use. 2. include smoking prevention in your childcare agenda. clarification about the harms of smoking in consultations from 5 years of age. for teens talk about the effects on appearance sports performance and costs. discuss electronic cigarette. 3. recommend treatment for caregivers who smoke. refer to specialized smoking cessation services. 4. offer treatment to adolescent smokers users who want to quit smoking. moderate or severe adolescent users may benefit from drug treatment. periodic follow up should occur due to the high chance of relapse. 5. closely assess the risk of psychiatric symptoms during treatment. suicidal ideation and suicide may occur which must be monitored and treated. 6. do not recommend the use of electronic cigarettes. the harmful effects are similar. 7. if second hand smoke cannot be eliminated agree on measures that minimize exposure. in medical schools at all levels of teaching and learning and for all health professionals smoking cessation training should be provided. the prevention of active and passive smoking as well as forms of intervention in smoking cessation should be part of the curriculum of pediatric and family medicine residency programs due to the great importance of abuse in the general population. recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.5. obesity in childhood and adolescence between 1975 and 2016 the prevalence of obesity between 5 and 19 years increased on average from 0.7 to 5.6 in girls and from 0.8 to 7.8 in boys in all geographic regions of the world. the study estimated that in 2016 there were 50 million obese girls and 74 million obese boys worldwide.577 in brazil the 2015 national school health survey identified a prevalence of overweight and obesity in 23.3 and 8.5 in students from 13 to 17 years old respectively.578 11.5.1.

hypertension hyperglycemia hyperinsulinemia inflammation and oxidative stress favoring the evolution of fatty striae in the aorta and coronary arteries as well as other atherosclerotic lesions.580 about 50 of obese children aged 6 years and one obese parent will have obesity in adulthood 80 of obese adolescents in this condition will be an obese adult.580 11.5.3. etiology it is the result of the interaction between genetic factors and environmental factors sedentary lifestyle and excessive calorie consumption the focus of treatment strategies are among the latter.580 581 the secondary causes of childhood obesity are described in chart 11.1. 11.5.4. treatment the therapeutic approach for overweight in children and adolescents should be multiple and gradual with progressive evaluation of the results obtained and involve better diet quality reduced calorie intake increased physical activity and meal replacements. pharmacotherapy orlistat is currently the only one approved for use in adolescents and bariatric 855 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 surgery has only been used

hypertension in childhood and adolescence bp screening data in childhood and adolescence show a prevalence of sah of up to 8.2 582 583 which decreases to approximately 3.5 when measurements are repeated at clinical follow up. prehypertension is observed in approximately 2.2 to 3.5 of the population in overweight and obese adolescents it can reach 24.8 . it is also associated with sleep disorders 3.6 to 14 chronic kidney disease up to 50 diabetes mellitus 9.5 aorta narrowing 17 to 77 endocrine alterations 0.05 to 6 and prematurity 7.3 .584 although hypertension in children is more often due to a secondary cause with a defined etiology there has been an increase in the diagnoses of primary hypertension especially in older children and adolescents when other risk factors are associated such as overweight and obesity. blood pressure measurement is considered mandatory from the age of three on an annual basis or before this age when the child has a neonatal history history of prematurity history of aortic narrowing kidney disease diabetes mellitus or is using medication that can increase blood pressure. sah is defined by the blood pressure percentile in relation to age sex and height. the tables with gender age and height percentiles https pediatrics. aappublications.org content pediatrics 140 3 e2017 have been redefined in the american clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents facilitating the adoption of a single table containing the three parameters used and the assigned percentile. as we do not have specific tables for the brazilian population this criterion is used for our population. the first blood pressure measurement can be performed by the oscillometric method on the right arm using an appropriate cuff. if the result of this measurement is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile another measurement must be taken if the mean of these two measurements is still 90th percentile two measurements by auscultatory method should be performed. table 11.1 shows blood pressure levels in normal and hypertensive children and adolescents. recommendation level i level of

dyslipidemia are similar in adults and children. it is worth mentioning some specificities in childhood such as the higher prevalence of more severe primary types that do not allow survival until adulthood if not treated intensively and early such as familial hypercholesterolaemia heterozygous or homozygous and lipoprotein lipase deficiency monogenic hypertriglyceridemia . among the secondary causes ketogenic diet used in refractory epilepsy has been identified more frequently in addition to obesity physical inactivity and inadequate diet considered at epidemic levels in the country.589

diseases 12.1. introduction the population is aging in brazil and in the world. the brazilian population has maintained an aging trend in recent years and has gained 4.8 million elderly people since 2012 surpassing the 30.2 million mark in 2017 according to the national household sample survey pnad.594 in 2012 there were 25.4 million people aged 60 and over. the 4.8 million new elderly in five years correspond to an 18 growth in this age group which has become increasingly representative in brazil. women are the majority in this group with 16.9 million 56 of the elderly while elderly men are 13.3 million 44 of the group .594 between 2012 and 2017 the number of elderly grew in all units of the federation with rio de janeiro and rio grande do sul being the states with the highest proportion of elderly both with 18.6 of their populations within this age group. amap in turn is the state with the lowest percentage of the elderly with only 7.2 of the population figure 12.1 .594 according to the who the world s population of elderly people is increasing and in the coming decades the world s population of people over 60 years of age will grow from the current 841 million to 2 billion by 2050 making chronic diseases and well being new global public health challenges.595 by 2020 we will have for the first time in history more people over 60 than children under five reported the who in a health and aging series in the lancet medical journal noting that 80 of older people will live in low and middle income countries.595 the who also states that the increase in longevity especially in high income countries is mainly due to the decline in cvd deaths such as stroke and ischemic heart disease through simple and cost effective interventions to reduce smoking and high bp.595 old people or very old people aged 85 and over will increase by 351 between 2010 and 2050 compared with an increase of 188 for the population aged 65 and over and an increase of 22 for the 65 year old population figure 12.2 .596 over the next 10 to 15 years people in every region of the world will suffer more deaths and disabilities from noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease cancer and diabetes.596 these data are directly linked to inadequate lifestyles of the population such as physical inactivity obesity and stress leading to an increased prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension smoking diabetes and dyslipidemia with consequent increase in mortality and cv morbidity. ah is the leading risk factor for death and cvd worldwide597 598 figure 12.3.597 599 the

populations should be implemented as soon as possible and start as early as possible. some considerations related to the population aspects of risk factors will be discussed specifically in this chapter and others. 12.2. population aspect of smoking cigarette smoking is one of the leading and preventable causes of mortality in the world. this habit accounts for 12 of adult mortality worldwide which corresponds to 5 million people if this persists 10 million people per year will die and 70 of these deaths will occur in developing countries. specifically in brazil the national congress approved the text of the global framework convention on tobacco use fctc through legislative decree 1012 of october 28 2005 and the brazilian government ratified the 2005 convention which entered into force on february 1 2006. the primary goal of the fctc is to preserve present and future generations from the devastating health social environmental and economic consequences of smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke. it establishes some of its obligations to draft and update smoking control policy establish an international coordination and cooperation mechanism with other states parties and protect national policies against the interests of the tobacco industry. world no tobacco day was created in 1987 by the member states of the world health organization to draw the world s attention to the epidemic of smoking and preventable tobacco related diseases and deaths there are over 1 billion smokers in the world and 80 of them are in low and middle income countries where the effects of smoking related illnesses and deaths is highest current smokers are presumed to consume around 6 trillion cigarettes every year. 12.3. may 31st world no tobacco day federal law 12546 2011 in force

revealed a 14.8 drop in smokers in brazil in people over 18 years. among men the percentage of smokers was 18.1 and in women 12 . the capitals with the most smokers are porto alegre 23 curitiba 20 and s o paulo 19 and macei 8 jo o pessoa aracaju and salvador are the capitals with the lowest incidence of smoking in the northeast with 9 .602 there are strategies for tobacco control a prevention it is essential to prevent young people from trying cigarettes because if they do there is a 50 chance that they will become addicted. hence the importance of education from family and schools. enforcement of the anti smoking act which bans the advertisement of tobacco products and other actions directed at underage young people.603 b protection protect the population from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke and the influences that lead to smoking particularly those related to the social group. strictly enforce the anti smoking law which among other rules prohibited smoking in public environments.603 12.4. population aspects of obesity and overweight relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle habits such as income socioeconomic status nutritional status and physical inactivity with weight gain have been established.604 610 in addition especially in the last two decades international authorities have strongly recommended the implementation of effective obesity prevention policies. however no country in the world has succeeded in reversing the obesity epidemic.611 612 a number of factors may explain the failure to combat obesity but perhaps the most important is the way it is still understood by most people. instead of being perceived as a chronic complex disease the result of the interaction of genetic and environmental variables strongly influenced by socio economic and cultural factors with a highly obesogenic environment obesity is seen as a personal failure. obese people are often blamed for their disease being judged lazy undisciplined unmotivated and negligent.611 612 from a population standpoint several measures have already been tested and found to be successful locally or for a predetermined period of time. the great challenge is to institute these measures in a more comprehensive and lasting way and to identify cultural and regional particularities that allow adaptations of these policies to each of the realities.613 614 interventions in schools are the most common and most promising precisely because of their educational and anti obesity character in the early stages of life. modifications in school lunches sedentary lifestyle health education are examples of measures that have been beneficial not only for the children and adolescents involved but also for adults in the same circle. fighting physical inactivity in an organized way with mass campaigns in addition to more regionalized actions focused on a particular exercise practice has also been shown to be beneficial for reducing obesity. there is also a lot of research focused on reducing the amount of physical activity required to achieve the weight reduction benefit. such studies arise precisely from the lack of time to devote to exercise which ends up being the justification for the sedentary lifestyle of most people.615 finally there are still population actions aimed at improving people s diets. such measures are extremely varied but ultimately use mostly financial interventions to target dietary choices and habits that are associated with overweight obesity. there are examples of taxing sweetened beverages financial incentives to purchase healthy foods types of financial penalties for buying unhealthy foods reductions in health care related health insurance costs and maintaining healthy diets.618 a concern that should be highlighted in view of population aging is the high prevalence of obesity in older populations. 862 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 such individuals should be evaluated very carefully since the identification of obesity is not so simple but mainly because of its association with musculoskeletal diseases diabetes and ami.619 12.5. population aspects of hypertension the treatment of hypertension is known to be effective in relation to the individual but from the population point of view it has been frustrating for many reasons.620 624 these begin with the lack of education in general and particularly in health which prevents knowledge about the disease and its importance as one of the main cv risk factors.594 599 they go through the difficulty of accessing health services for the correct diagnosis proper treatment with guidance on lifestyle and medication use and end with the great challenge of treatment compliance.620 624 these assumptions alone are sufficient to definitively indicate the actions that can effectively modify the natural history of hypertension and interfere with the equation cv risk morbidity and mortality. these actions at the collective level and focusing on primary and primordial prevention will have a great interface with other cvd risk factors.10 620 626 primordial prevention of risk factors and primary actions on installed risk factors prevention actions although presenting much better cost effective results demand more time for their appearance. for this reason huge amounts are spent on secondary or even primary prevention measures but with a focus on medicalization which in an misleading way shows favorable changes in short term statistics and may even give political results with immediatist benefits.10 620 626 it is evident that population intervention must involve the involvement of society as a whole. it should be part of a government policy and linked in a partnership with organized civil society non governmental organizations and industries in general especially food producers and beneficiaries. every action will only achieve the expected objectives if it is developed collectively with multidimensional action.10 620 626 it must be highlighted particularly for hypertension but has a strong interface with other cv risk factors education as a whole and in particular health education for the dissemination of knowledge about cv risk factors and the understanding of the importance of healthy lifestyles 10 620 626 legis lat ion enforcement which encourages the production of healthy foods and discourages and foods harmful to health 10 624 625 the encouragement of families to have healthy lifestyles with the possibility of monetary benefits in case of lifestyle changes maintenance of ideal weight decreased sodium intake regular physical activity increased fruit intake vegetables and cereals smoking cessation the provision of safe areas for the practice of regular physical activity provision of a simplified means for basic assessment of key cv risk factors bp body mass index blood glucose cholesterol and smoking status 2 620 access to basic medicines when preventive measures fail and the use of drugs to prevent disease is needed.10 620 12.6. population aspects of dyslipidemia scientific knowledge leaves no doubt about the relevance of dyslipidemias as an important risk cv factor.2 628 there is also a general recognition that individual or even collective actions aimed at treatment although useful and beneficial are very expensive and much lower cost effective even in developed countries.2 627 631 from these premises we have opened a huge door of opportunity. it is unthinkable to admit that the health system especially in developing countries such as brazil can adequately afford the high costs of treating established diseases.2 629 630 632 thus population based primary prevention becomes a cost effective and absolutely sustainable long term alternative.633 636 this must be the fundamental mission of any government. public policies for food quality control health education at all levels with priority for young people and finally a health system that allows universal access to care and when necessary drugs as the last option.633 637 638 it should be noted that small reductions in each of the risk factors may promote large reductions in cv events. additional benefit can be obtained through the adoption of healthy lifestyles in society that will bring benefits to all risk factors that are completely interconnected smoking poor diet overweight dyslipidemia ah and physical inactivity .632 634 636 thus the entire population with an initial focus on children and adolescents should be encouraged to adopt healthy diets maintain adequate weight or decrease weight for this purpose practice regular physical activity with at least moderate intensity and smoking cessation. the government should offer political legal and financial conditions for the implementation of these actions in the educational field for the entire population.2 627 628 636 12.6.1. general practice measures639 encourage exclusive breastfeeding up to at least 6 months decrease salt content in the preparation of processed and industrialized foods encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables as well great supply and accessibility decrease intake of saturated and trans fats replacing with unsaturated fats decrease sugar content in industrialized beverages reduce food portion sizes and limit excessive caloric intake healthy food supply in all public institutions incentive and collaboration policies with producers for the production and commercialization of healthy foods incentives and continuous health education policy for the population as a whole with emphasis on children and adolescents improved labeling of processed and industrialized foods. 863 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 12.7. population aspects of physical activity physical activity includes all forms of human movement and active life including walking exercise as well as sports and is a natural behavior that confers many benefits.648 649 the urgency of addressing ncd including cvd which contribute to a significant burden of premature death disease disability and economic burden for all countries is emphasized.648 649 to reaffirm that physical inactivity is a major factor in modifiable risks to ncd. as an important point of the strategy to reduce the burden of ncd as articulated in the who global action plan for ncd prevention and control 2013 2020.627 648 649 recognizing this strong link between physical activity and major noncommunicable diseases who member states agreed on a relative 10 reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity by 2025 as one of nine global targets for improving the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases. in brazil according to vigitel 2017 physical activities practiced in four domains leisure occupational activity commuting and domestic activities which allow building multiple indicators of physical activity standard.650 in addition the frequency of adults who in their free time spend a three or more hours of the day watching television b three or more hours of the day using computer mobile or tablet and c three or more hours of the day watching television or using a computer mobile phone or tablet. the frequency of adults practicing leisure time physical activity equivalent to at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week ranged from 29.9 in s o paulo to 49.6 in the federal district. among men the highest frequencies were found in macap 57.1 s o lu s 54.1 and distrito federal 53.8 and the lowest in s o paulo 36.0 jo o pessoa. 39.5 and fortaleza 42.1 . among women the highest frequencies were observed in the federal district 45.9 palmas 41.9 and curitiba 37.7 . the smallest were in s o paulo 24.8 porto alegre 26.7 and recife 28.1 650 showing a high prevalence of sedentary individuals. physical activity in leisure time is increasing. in 2009 the indicator was 30.3 and in 2016 37.6 . prevalence decreases with age being more common among young people from 18 to 24 years old.650 the situation is not different from other countries whether developed or developing. prevalence in 2016 was more than twice as high in high income countries 36.8 35.0 38.3 than in low income countries 16.2 14.9 9.9 and physical inactivity increased in high income countries over time 31.6 27.1 37.2 in 2001 . if current trends continue the global physical activity target for 2025 a relative 10 reduction in physical inactivity will not be met. policies to increase population levels of physical activity need to be prioritized and expanded urgently.649 physical inactivity is one of the top 10 risk factors for global mortality causing about 3.2 million deaths each year.651 652 sedentary adults have a 20 30 increase in risk of all mortality causes compared with those who do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or equivalent as recommended by who. regular physical activity reduces the risk of ischemic heart disease stroke diabetes and breast and colon cancer. in addition regular physical activity is a major determinant of energy expenditure and is therefore critical to energy balance weight control and obesity prevention.651 652 12.8. population approach to increased physical activity the proposed policy options aim to promote the implementation of the global strategy regarding diet physical activity and health and other relevant strategies and to promote the additional benefits of increasing physical activity levels in population such as improved educational performance and social and mental health benefits coupled with cleaner air reduced traffic less congestion and links to healthy child development and sustainable development.654 655 in addition interventions to increase participation in physical activity throughout the population for which favorable cost effectiveness data are emerging and should be promoted. the objective is to contribute to achieving the voluntary global goals listed below 654 655 a relative 10 reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity. it can stop the rise of diabetes and obesity. lead to a 25 relative reduction in the prevalence of hypertension or contain the prevalence of increased bp according to national realities. proposed policy options include adopt and implement national guidelines on physical activity for health. consider establishing a multisectoral committee or similar body to provide strategic leadership and coordination. develop appropriate partnerships and involve all segments of society concerned levels of government non governmental organizations ngo civil society scientific societies and economic operators in the active and appropriate implementation of actions aimed at increasing physical activity at all ages. develop policy measures in cooperation with relevant sectors to promote physical activity through activities of daily living including through active transport recreation leisure and sport for example national state and municipal urban planning and transport policies to improve accessibility acceptability and safety of support infrastructure for walking and cycling. improvement in the provision of quality physical education in educational settings for elementary and high school students including opportunities for physical activity before during and after the formal school day. actions to support and encourage physical activity for all initiatives. creation and preservation of natural environments that facilitate physical activity in schools universities workplaces clinics and hospitals and in the wider community with a particular focus on providing infrastructure to support active transportation such as walking and cycling recreation and active play and participation in all types of sports. 864 updated

actions aimed at increasing physical activity to contribute to the development of an evidence base for effective and cost effective actions.654 655 12.9. socioeconomic and environmental factors and associated diseases in cardiovascular prevention the main determinants of population health are multiple and classifiable in the fields of biology environment physical social and economic behaviors lifestyle and health care.656 it is estimated that major socioeconomic determinants represent 75 while genetic biological and behavioral factors together account for approximately 25 of the population s health657 658 chart 12.1 . the literature reports different models that intend to describe the complex relationship between the multiple factors that influence the socioeconomic determinants of health one of the most mentioned is the dahlgren and whitehead659 model figure 12.4 . according to rose 660 the socioeconomic determinants underlie the pyramid of health inequalities and consequently the right to health cannot be guaranteed only by the health sector requiring economic and social public policies.660 prospective studies have shown that in brazil and in developed countries low socioeconomic status defined as low status employment low educational and income levels and living in poorer residential areas contribute to increased cv mortality and all cause death.664 668 through

association between the indicator and mortality rates showing the importance of improving the living conditions of the population in the reduction of cv mortality.664 the american heart association document on the influence of social factors on cvd revealed that populations with lower educational levels have a higher prevalence of cv risk factors a higher incidence of cv events and a higher cv mortality rate regardless of other demographic factors.665 12.10. health and sustainable development health is a timeless value. good health is a precondition for work and a measure of sustainable development.666 the who created the commission of social determinants of health in 2005 to define health promotion directed at health equity in populations and a global movement to reach it. in an extensive evidence based publication who prioritized the following actions early childhood education healthy housing urban and rural infrastructure universal access to health and other services employment quality social protection inclusion social gender equality. regardless of policy options it advocated health equity in all policies systems and programs through fair financing and good global governance . it recommended as an example the united nations un millennium project prepared in 2000 during the millennium summit the largest meeting of world leaders aimed at establishing a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty.667 668 the 2015 goals known as the millennium development goals mdg represented a paradigm shift to improve the health of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. they are eradicate extreme poverty and hunger implement a universal basic education promote gender equality and empower women reduce child mortality improve maternal health combat aids malaria and other infectious diseases ensure environmental sustainability and develop a global partnership for development. subsequently in 2015 the who health report health in 2015 from mgds to sdgs highlighted health progress on the mdg and redefined priority actions to achieve the new goals for sustainable development sdg .668 the sdg which make up agenda 2030 contain more numerous and

droughts fires storms floods polluting energies antibiotic resistant agents aging migrations increased global burden of ncd indivisible pillars of sustainable development.669 chart 12.2 . in this context brazil launched the strategic action plan for coping with ncd in brazil 2011 2022 at the un assembly and implemented a cncd surveillance system vigitel over the last decade that allows the national and global monitoring of ncd targets representing a breakthrough in ncd surveillance in the country.670 between 2000 and 2011 brazil recorded an average decline of 2.5 per annum in all major ncd with a significant decrease of 3.3 in cvd observed in both sexes and in all regions of the country.671 however between 2015 and 2016 there was a trend of stability in mortality rates due to ncd which may be a consequence of the change in risk factor behavior and worsening of risk factors living conditions access to services unemployment caused by the economic and the social crisis.672 673 if these trends are maintained brazil may not meet the who un target set for the reduction in premature mortality from ncd in agenda 2030. 12.11. cardiovascular prevention environment sustainability and associated diseases hippocrates the author of airs waters and places 400 bc was probably the first to recognize a relationship between disease and the environment including the effects of climate and lifestyle.674 numerous aspects regardinf the quality of the physical environment air pollution cycle paths green areas parks and behavioral factors smoking high fat diets physical inactivity are determining factors for increasing or decreasing risks for cvd.675 since 2004 the american heart association has recognized exposure to air pollution as an important modifiable risk factor for cvd morbidity and mortality in populations with a higher risk attributable to particulate matter pm over gaseous components.676 particulate matter 2.5 m pm2.5 is the most important environmental risk factor with higher risk than gaseous components posing a major threat to public health.677 short term pm2.5 elevations increase the relative risk of acute cv events by 1 to 3 within a few days. long term exposures years increase the risk by 10 which is partly attributable to the development of cardiometabolic disorders such as high blood pressure diabetes mellitus among others.677 866 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 the pathophysiological mechanisms of changes caused by pm include increased blood viscosity vascular reactivity induction of a systemic inflammatory state thrombosis changes in cardiac autonomic control arrhythmia hypertension development and progression of atherosclerosis acute myocardial infarction heart failure and other cvd.676 the finer particles are more harmful to cv health given their greater ability to penetrate the airways. when inhaled they penetrate deep into the lung tissue inducing oxidative stress and inflammation through the release of il 6 il 1 tnf by macrophages. parallel to the intense oxidative stress that begins in the lung tissue trophic effects on vascular and cardiac cells occur increased generation of reactive oxygen species impairment of nitric oxide mediated vasodilation endothelial dysfunction and consequently development and or progression of atherosclerosis.678 the harvard six cities study involving populations from six us cities revealed that the risk of myocardial infarction in a city with polluted air increases by 5 compared with that of clean air.679 in the city of s o paulo it was observed that pollution is so high that it would be the equivalent to smoking two cigarettes a day.677 in the brazilian amazon burning biomass bush increased mortality from cv and respiratory events among the elderly especially from acute myocardial infarction.680 particles and gases released at high altitudes circulate throughout the troposphere and can be transported over long distances with impacts on a global scale.680 after forest fires in canada high concentrations up to 30 times higher of mostly fine pm have been recorded in the city of baltimore in the united states. thus environmental threats are not limited only to industrial gases and lead particles from motor vehicles in urban areas but also to the pm generated by biomass burning in rural areas and it is estimated that air pollution a growing public health problem will double cvd mortality by 2050.680 the expert position paper on air pollution and cardiovascular disease of the european society of cardiology revealed that in 2010 air pollution accounted for 3.1 million of the 52.8 million deaths for all causes and ages. the american heart association reports that 60 000 americans and 6 000 canadians die each year from short or long term exposure to airborne pollutants.681 study shows that living near 50 m high traffic roads can increase risk sudden death.682 other factors related to lifestyle eating habits and socioeconomic variables may exacerbate the effects of exposure to pollution such as smoking a diet high in fats and sugars physical inactivity and the use of licit alcohol and illicit marijuana drugs. the key recommendations of the environment the heart campaign campaign organized in 2015 by the european society of cardiology and the european heart network ehn to european policy makers to promote a healthy environment for a healthy heart were 1 include the air and noise pollution in the group of modifiable risk factors for cvd 2 include clean air and noise reduction in all areas of health policy 3 adopt who air quality limits 4 intensely reduce the emission of automotive gases 5 promote green urban planning to reduce pollution and promote physical activity 6 promote clean forms of energy low emission vehicles and non combustion renewable energy sources 7 guarantee funds for studies on the effects of environmental stress on the cv system 8 support events addressing ncd social economic and environmental inequalities regarding access to health.683 684 brian garvey685 from the university of strathclyde scotland in the preface to larissa bombardi s study geography of pesticides in brazil and connections with the european union stated that every sick community every poisoned field every polluted watercourse threatens to extinguish an alternative variety of life . the major steps in developing an action plan for addressing cv disease risk factors 686 are described in figure 12.5. 12.12. conclusion commitment from universities scientific societies organized civil society state and municipal health secretariats state and municipal education secretariats the ministry of health

introduction cardiovascular disease cvd is the leading cause of death worldwide and in brazil leading to increased morbidity and disability adjusted life year daly . despite the decrease in mortality rates and daly standardized by age in brazil possibly as a result of successful health policies their total number is increasing mainly due to aging and illnesses in the population.1 classical risk factors hypertension dyslipidemia obesity sedentary lifestyle smoking diabetes and family history raise the pre test probability of cvd particularly of coronary artery disease cad and determine primary and secondary prevention. several other factors including sociodemographic ethnic cultural dietary and behavioral aspects can also explain the differences in cvd burden among populations and their trends over the decades. the implementation of health policies among them encouraging healthy lifestyle habits and providing access to primary and secondary cvd prevention measures associated with the treatment of cardiovascular cv events are essential to control cvd in all countries including brazil. the i brazilian cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology sociedade brasileira de cardiologia sbc published in 2013 2 aimed at helping reduce cv mortality as established by the world health assembly in may 2012 sbc reaffirmed its commitment to decreasing the premature cvd mortality rate by 25 .3 however the reduction in cvd mortality has reached a plateau in the past five years in brazil with significant regional variation suggesting the need for renewing strategies to combat these diseases.4 with this purpose sbc revisited its cv prevention guideline 2 proposing to update themes related to the primary prevention of cvd and suggesting strategies that could assist brazilian cardiologists in reducing morbidity and mortality from these groups of causes. the brazilian cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 updates the strategies that address classical risk factors and discusses new concepts such as the need to gather knowledge about emerging risk factors for instance spirituality socioeconomic and environmental factors as well as additional strategies like the use of vaccines. we hope to contribute to renew the sbc commitment with the brazilian society and the strategic action plan for tackling chronic non communicable diseases ncd 5 of which cvd is the main component with an instrument that will allow systematized access to the current literature disseminating the knowledge necessary to resume the decreasing trend in cv mortality in brazil. 1. risk stratification 1.1. cardiovascular risk stratification to prevent and treat atherosclerosis the first manifestation of atherosclerotic disease in approximately half of the people who have this complication is an acute coronary event. therefore identifying asymptomatic individuals with higher predisposition is crucial for effective prevention associated with the correct definition of therapeutic targets. the so called risk scores and algorithms based on regression analysis of population studies were created to estimate the severity of cvd substantially enhancing the identification of overall risk. the framingham gloal risk score grs 6 included the estimate of 10 years of coronary and cerebrovascular events peripheral arterial disease or heart failure hf and was the score adopted by the department of atherosclerosis of sbc departamento de aterosclerose da sociedade brasileira de cardiologia sbc da .7 in addition individuals who have multiple risk factors for cv subclinical atherosclerosis or already had manifestations of cvd have a high risk for events and can be classified differently. thus the new cv risk stratification proposed by the sbc da defines four levels of cv risk very high risk high risk moderate risk low risk 795 updated updated cardiovascular prevention

between 70 and 189 mg dl with ors 20 for males and 10 for females. strategies for primary or secondary prevention of the disease are proposed based on the characterization of cv risk. 1.2. very high risk individuals who have a significant atherosclerotic disease coronary cerebrovascular or peripheral vascular with or without clinical events belong to this category chart 1.1 . 1.3. high risk patients in primary prevention who present ors 20 men or 10 women or aggravating risk conditions based on clinical data or subclinical atherosclerosis chart 1.2 . 1.4. moderate risk the estimated risk for atherosclerotic disease results from the sum of the risk associated with each risk factor and the powering caused by synergisms between some of these factors. given the complexity of these interactions intuitive risk allocation often leads to under or overestimation of higher or lower risk cases respectively. among the algorithms created to stratify cv risk the last updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis prevention recommends the use of ors which estimates the risk for myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident cva hf fatal or non fatal or peripheral vascular insufficiency in 10 years. based on this score individuals with grs ranging from 5 to 20 males and 5 to 10 females are classified as moderate risk. patients with diabetes mellitus dm without sad criteria or rs are also considered at moderate risk. many middle aged individuals belong to this risk category chart 1.3 . part of the latest recommendations leans towards inflammatory conditions and the use of coronary calcium to restratify patients at moderate risk.8 1.5. low risk any estimated cv risk based on findings of observational studies inevitably has limitations related to calibration and discriminatory power the attempt to allocate a certain risk percentage to each patient collides with individual aspects not covered by risk prediction equations. the idea of restoring the concept of aggravating risk understood as individual phenotypic expressions causally related to greater chances of a cv outcome to improve somewhat the individualization of the algorithms created from large population samples has been gaining strength.8 however in the low risk population stratum an aggravating risk in those with less than 5 chance of having a cv outcome in 10 years6 8 would hardly have a decisive influence in this relatively short time interval. on the other hand as age is one of the most important determinants of risk for cv events a man aged 62 years without sad normotensive non smoker non diabetic and with optimal levels of serum lipids would already be classified by ors as moderate risk even without any aggravating factor.6 796 updated updated

considered at low cv risk are those aged 30 to 74 years of both genders whose risk for cv events calculated by grs is lower than 5 in 10 years6 7 chart 1.4 . although the calcium score is not recommended for low risk patients non diabetic individuals at moderate risk without a family history of premature coronary disease who have a zero calcium score can be considered at low risk and postpone the start of the cholesterol lowering therapy with statins.8 aggravating risk factors are not used in patients considered at low cv risk. the north american guideline of 2018 considers

factor for cad.11 genetic12 and clinical studies with statins and other lipid lowering drugs provide ample evidence that lower ldl c levels are associated with the proportional decrease in cv outcomes including myocardial infarction cva and cv death.13 14 the 2017 updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia incorporated some changes in the approach of dyslipidemias compared to the previous version.7 one of the changes was that fasting was no longer mandatory for total cholesterol tc and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c tests provided that the laboratory specifies the situation in the report without fasting or with 12 hour fasting. as for triglycerides tg it might increase in the absence of fasting. in hypertriglyceridemia particularly with a value 440 mg dl a new collection after 12 hour fasting is crucial.15 apolipoprotein apoa1 and apob levels can be determined in a sample without prior fasting and moderately high tg levels do not influence immunochemical methods. the analytical performance of this methodology is good and the levels can be measured in automated platforms with an immunoturbidimetry or nephelometry profile. there is evidence of an independent association between elevated lipoprotein a lp a and cvd risk in the general population 16 not only for the lipid content of lp a but also for its prothrombotic and proinflammatory properties. the gold

women and 5 20 in men high 10 in women and 20 in men and very high clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease 30 risk. chapter 1 presents the complete risk stratification. specific targets for each category were defined in accordance with table 2.1.7 the updated brazilian guideline for dyslipidemia and atherosclerosis prevention7 also included a change in cv risk stratification for individuals already using statins. considering the imprecision of risk calculation in these patients the guideline proposes using a correction factor for tc to estimate the risk score in this context derived from studies that compared the efficacy of different statins in the doses used and that allowed an average ldl c reduction of 30 with the treatment.17 this situation applies to most patients who take moderate doses of statins. given the average tc reduction of 30 with statins patients who use these medicines should have their tc multiplied by 1.43.17 moreover in the initial approach the target for individuals who are not on lipid lowering treatment should be decreasing the percentage of ldl c and non hdl c. for those already on lipid lowering therapy the recent guideline also established a reduction in absolute ldl c and non hdl c values with the treatment as shown in table 2.2. 2.1.1. familial hypercholesterolemia fh is a genetic condition characterized by very high ldl c levels and therefore increased risk for premature atherosclerotic disease especially of a coronary event. however despite its importance this condition is still underdiagnosed and undertreated.18 19 this version of the guideline reinforces that greatly increased cholesterol values could indicate fh after excluding secondary dyslipidemias. adult individuals with tc values 310 mg dl or children and adolescents with levels 230 mg dl should be evaluated for this possibility. among the clinical scores available for fh we highlight the dutch lipid clinic network score used in our field and presented in table 2.3. in addition to clinical scores the genetic test for fh is a very useful but not mandatory tool to confirm suspected cases and screen relatives of established index cases. 2.2.

hf compared to non diabetic individuals.34 as cad patients are excluded the incidence of hf in the diabetic population decreases but remains significantly higher than in non diabetic individuals. in type 1 diabetes above 7 each 1 increment in glycated hemoglobin hba1c was associated with a 30 increase in hf risk 35 while type 2 diabetes was associated with a 16 increase in the risk regardless of other risk factors including obesity smoking hypertension dyslipidemia and coronary disease.36 37 diabetic cardiomyopathy is characterized by myocardial fibrosis and left ventricular hypertrophy with diastolic dysfunction initially asymptomatic and that progresses slowly to diastolic or systolic dysfunction followed by hf with clinical repercussion.38 occasionally diabetic cardiomyopathy can manifest as arrhythmias and sudden death. mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological process include mitochondrial dysfunction oxidative stress inflammation dysfunction in the mitochondrial ca2 management activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system raas and the sympathetic nervous system sns cardiac autonomic neuropathy endoplasmic reticulum stress microvascular dysfunction and disorders of cardiac energy metabolism.39 41 3.1.1. myocardial risk estimate despite the lack of an universally accepted method to estimate hf risk specifically in diabetic individuals methods such as plasma brain natriuretic peptide bnp echocardiographic evaluation of diastolic dysfunction and risk calculators such as the health abc heart failure score and the framingham heart failure risk score are often used to estimate the future risk for symptomatic hf. elaborating a standardized strategy to screen and intervene in patients at hf risk might be difficult due to its different definitions the heterogeneity of its prevalence in various populations its inconstant duration until the development of clinic hf or left ventricular dysfunction and the varying interventions to modify or treat risk factors. as we shall see below the health abc heart failure score is the mechanism with the highest sensitivity and specificity and should be recommended as the primary strategy in risk stratification of symptomatic hf. nonetheless bnp can be used concomitantly to reclassify individuals at high risk for hf. the evidence that supports the use of bnp in diabetic patients to predict the hf risk is based on two randomized controlled trials. as shown in table 3.1 these programs recruited 1 674 patients without hf for randomization and identified a total of 29 subsequent events of hospitalization for hf. the combined statistical power of these studies is limited but provides the perspective for the potential benefit of screening based on biomarkers such as bnp. diastolic dysfunction on the echocardiogram historically experts disagree on recommendations for echocardiographic diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction as 804 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 shown in the 2009 guidelines of the american society of echocardiography and the european association of cardiovascular imaging ase eacvi and the canberra study criteria csc .44 45 based on these recommendations epidemiological studies and a meta analysis46 47 suggest that preclinical diastolic dysfunction stage b hf defined as diastolic dysfunction with normal systolic function and without hf symptoms is common in dm and that its presence increases by 61 to 70 the risk for developing symptomatic hf stages c and d . despite being simple and non invasive 46 47 the echocardiographic diagnosis for patients at higher risk for hf does not seem to be as cost effective as the measurement of bnp 48 49 although these data are not specifically available for the brazilian population. the diagnostic criteria became more specific and less sensitive in the 2016 ase eacvi guideline 50 51 despite the simplification. with these criteria the prevalence of diastolic dysfunction in the general population ranges from 1 to 7 . however no studies have been designed to focus on primary prevention based on this diagnostic criterion. risk scores for future hf the hf risk in patients with dm and metabolic syndrome ms can be predicted with clinical scores. although no scores have been developed specifically for patients with dm or ms several studies have demonstrated good performance in these populations. among the most used scores are the i health abc heart failure score 52 the ii the framingham heart failure risk score 53 and the iii and the atherosclerosis risk in communities aric heart failure risk score.54 the variables included in the framingham heart failure risk score are age gender cad diabetes left ventricular hypertrophy based on electrocardiogram ecg valvular disease heart rate and systolic blood pressure sbp . the health abc heart failure score includes the framingham variables with the following differences addition of serum albumin serum creatinine and smoking replacement of glucose for diabetes and exclusion of valvular disease. the aric heart failure risk score includes age ethnicity gender cad diabetes sbp use of medicines for blood pressure bp heart rate smoking and body mass index bmi . designed for a community population of older adults the health abc heart failure score reached a positive and negative predictive power of 10 and 15 in comparison with the framingham heart failure risk score52 and 2 to 4 above the aric heart failure risk.54 the health abc heart failure score is an instrument validated in observational and intervention studies and thus considered a reference for estimating the future hf risk in patients with dm and ms detailed description in figure 3.1 . although all scores are designed with only the variables listed above the addition of bnp or nt probnp as linear variables would significantly increase the predictive power of all scores.52 54 based on the thresholds used in the studies pontiac43 and stop hf 42 we suggest reclassifying individuals with bnp 50 pg ml or nt probnp 125 pg ml into a higher risk category. 3.1.2. preventive therapies for individuals at high and very high risk for heart failure in 5 years and secondary prevention for those with clinical heart failure drug therapies for dm2 that impact hf as stated previously above 7 the hf risk increases by 8 for each 1 increment in hba1c while a 1 reduction decreases the risk by 16 . although several clinical trials have investigated the effect of metformin on the cv system based on the pathophysiology of insulin resistance the effect of this class directly on hf remains inconclusive. studies with insulin and sulfonylureas showed a neutral effect on hf and glucagon like peptide 1 glp 1 agonists analogs55 and acarbose56 proved to be neutral regarding the risk for hf hospitalizations and mortality. more recently three large studies empa reg canvas and declare revealed that sodium glucose 2 sglt2 cotransporter inhibitors reduced cv outcomes including hf hospitalizations.57 58 hf mortality among individuals who used empagliflozin was significantly lower than in those using a placebo. the studies empa reg and declare associated the risk of taking these drugs with a higher rate of genital infections in the group using empagliflozin and dapagliflozin while the canvas study showed an increased risk of lower limb amputation.57 58 together all three sglt2 inhibitors available empagliflozin canagliflozin and dapagliflozin reduce the risk for hf hospitalization even in asymptomatic patients at the start of treatment. therefore the use of these drugs is recommended for patients with dm or ms at high or very high risk for hf. among the hypoglycemic agents that increase the chance of hf we highlight the thiazolidinediones record study rosiglitazone and proactive pioglitazone 59 60 and a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor dpp 4i the saxagliptin savor timi 53 .61 in the studies record and savor timi patients with hf also had higher subsequent mortality rates. thus rosiglitazone pioglitazone and saxagliptin are contraindicated for patients with or at high risk for hf. 3.1.3. therapies focused on cardiac remodeling although only two clinical trials substantiate these recommendations patients with dm and ms at high and very high risk for hf seem to benefit from the early introduction of anti remodeling therapies such as raas inhibitors and beta blockers. based on these pharmacological strategies triggered by bnp or nt probnp levels above the risk threshold the studies pontiac43 and stop hf42 suggested reducing the risk for hf hospitalization and mortality. in patients with clinical hf clinical trials have demonstrated that the drug therapies tested were equally effective regardless of the presence of dm and ms. angiotensin blockers the charm trial candesartan 62 val heft valsartan 63 and atlas lisinopril 64 have demonstrated that the use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors acei or aldosterone receptor blockers arb favored the decrease in mortality and hospitalization among patients who had hf and reduced ejection fraction regardless of the presence of dm2 or ms. 805 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 mineralocorticoid antagonists patients with and without dm2 showed a reduction in mortality with the use of both spironolactone rales trial 65 and eplerenone emphasis hf .66 we underline the risk for hyperkalemia which might particularly affect patients with renal function deterioration and already using acei or arb. beta blockers in patients with dm and hf the use of metoprolol succinate merit hf bisoprolol cibis ii and carvedilol copernicus is recommended. they presented equal efficiency in patients with and without dm. a meta analysis that included six trials indicated a reduction in all cause mortality among patients with dm2 as well as in non diabetic individuals.67 nitrates and hydralazine approximately 40 of the patients randomized in the a heft trial had dm2. in this subpopulation the combination of a fixed dose of hydralazine and nitrate significantly reduced all cause mortality.68 ivabradine its use decreased mortality and hospitalizations in patients with and without dm2 in the shift study which involved 6 558 patients.69 the sacubitril valsartan combination is not well established yet in patients with preserved ejection fraction or at high risk for hf even for patients with reduced ejection fraction there is no specific study or subanalysis focused on the diabetic population. 3.2. atherosclerotic risk 3.2.1. metabolic syndrome diabetes mellitus and the continuous corollary of coronary artery disease ms and the dm comprise a spectrum of multisystemic diseases particularly in the vascular endothelium that contribute dramatically to the progression of pathophysiological substrates of cad. robust evidence suggests that cv risk increases even in stages that precede the clinical diagnosis of dm in 10 to 20 years based on current criteria. as ms is one of the main risk factors for dm considering it within a continuum of metabolic changes related to coronary atherothrombosis is reasonable.70 71 in fact estimates indicate that glucose metabolic changes precede the diagnosis of diabetes in 4 to 12 years72 figure 3.2 . while in early stages the overproduction of insulin can compensate its resistance after a certain point the pancreatic

adaptive to insulin resistance and cellular oxidative stress become irreversible. another mechanism that seems to occur even in early stages pre hyperglycemia is the accumulation of fatty acids in various tissues such as pancreas heart and liver accelerating the dysfunction in insulin production hepatic glucose production and left ventricular diastole.73 therefore even remotely before the period of hyperglycemia several cellular mechanisms cooperate to determine the endothelial dysfunction the phenotypic changes in lipids with hypertriglyceridemia and small dense ldl creating the ideal scenario for accelerated atherogenesis.74 together these data suggest that cad becomes accelerated many years before the onset of hyperglycemia. 3.2.2. primary prevention strategies for coronary artery disease in individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus corroborating the pathophysiological evidence weight control strategies with physical activity and intensive dietary guidance have proven to be the best available method to reduce the risk of a patient with ms and pre dm developing the clinical diagnosis of dm.75 76 lifestyle interventions decreased the risk for dm by 45 p 0.001 the risk for cv death by 41 p 0.033 and all cause mortality by 29 p 0.049 . in patients with established dm and microalbuminuria the randomized clinical trial steno 277 showed that a multifactorial approach to lifestyle significantly decreased cv morbidity and mortality in comparison with conventional treatment. 3.2.3. individual risk prediction for coronary artery disease in patients with diabetes mellitus and metabolic syndrome at least 68 of diabetic patients aged 65 years or older die from heart diseases most of them from cad followed by congestive hf.78 dm is considered an independent cv risk factor both in men and women raising in about two to four times the probability of clinical cad when compared to individuals without dm.79 moreover based on a meta analysis with almost 1 million individuals from 87 studies ms is associated with a twofold increase in cv outcomes and a 1.5 increase in all cause mortality exceeding the isolated risk of its components.80 the cad risk in the population with dm or ms however is not evenly distributed. several strategies for cad screening were implemented in recent decades although figure 3.2 progression of

tomography angiography did not reduce the risk for acute coronary syndrome acs or cv mortality.81 similarly in the studies diad82 and dynamit 83 the revascularization strategy guided by exercise stress test with scintigraphy did not improve cv and non cv outcomes compared to conventional medical treatment in 1 900 asymptomatic diabetic patients. currently the more efficient and practical resources to determine cv risk in diabetic patients have been the isolated control of its risk factors. subanalyses of the diabetes heart study84 and factor 6481 revealed that the factors with greater predictive power for acs risk were the use of statins and ldl c levels followed by glomerular filtration rate microalbuminuria and c reactive protein crp . the treatment of cv risk factors related to aggressive diabetes is the method more strongly associated with the reduction in cv morbidity and acs mortality in diabetic patients as demonstrated in the study steno 2.77 however as detailed below the most effective way of predicting risk and managing more or less intensive targets in primary prevention should be combining risk and coronary calcium scores. 3.2.4. risk calculator risk scores are among the most commonly used strategies consisting of estimating risk based on prospective data collected from cohorts of diabetic patients such as the ukpds the decode the darts the advance the swedish national diabetes register and the dcs.85 86 other calculators developed for mixed populations diabetics and non diabetics are also widely used ors sbc framingham pooled cohort equations ascvd reynolds score procam and others.74 the main advantage of these methods lies in their easy application in clinical practice as they consider the usual clinical data such as age laboratory test values and anthropometric information. the ukpds calculator is more recommended for diabetic patients idf21 guidelines nice canadian diabetes association australian national vascular disease prevention alliance and others and the ors is the more widely used in the brazilian diabetic and non diabetic population. nevertheless these and other strategies to estimate the progression of vascular diseases are still limited underestimating the risk in young patients with dm or recently diagnosed patients while overestimating the risk in individuals diagnosed for 10 years or with hba1c 9.0 .87 89 also the scores do not take into account the advances of the last 5 to 10 years such as new drugs and diagnostic methods and have relatively low predictive performance c statistic between 0.54 0.70 considering that 30 to 60 of individuals are at moderate risk.87 in this scenario adding the coronary calcium score to clinical risks has become the most efficient and cost effective alternative to estimate the cad risk in patients at moderate risk. 3.2.5. coronary artery calcium score coronary artery calcium cac is a highly specific characteristic of coronary atherosclerosis. the cac score cacs is an available consistent and reproducible method to evaluate the risk for future coronary events essentially by guiding primary prevention strategies.90 cacs in asymptomatic populations is cost effective for moderate risk patients90 and has a positive impact on adherence to treatment.91 the multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa developed a valuable and useful support tool for cacs to predict risk incorporating cacs to a clinical model using 10 year follow up data until the first manifestation of cad.92 the mesa score involves individuals aged 45 to 85 years providing cad risk in 10 years with and without cacs. the heinz nixdorf recall hnr and the dallas heart study validated the score.92 the greatest limitation of the mesa score is that its algorithm does not include all forms of atherosclerotic disease which differentiates it from the ors sbc.93 in an analysis of patients from the mesa study94 who had an estimate of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd of 5 to 7.5 in 10 years a cacs 0 was associated with an ascvd observed rate of 1.5 while any calcium score 0 was associated with an actual rate of events of at least 7.5 . in individuals from mesa with an ascvd risk between 7.5 and 20 a cacs 0 was associated with an event rate of around 4.5 while a cacs 0 was associated with a net benefit of statin therapy of approximately 10.5 . cacs should represent a way of segregating diabetic individuals with a higher atherosclerotic burden and possibly those suffering for longer the vascular effects of insulin resistance associated with endotheliopathy which begins in the early stages of pre diabetes.72 as explained above pathophysiologically vascular disease especially diabetic coronary disease starts long before its clinical diagnosis. however the strategies to map the progression of the vascular disease in earlier stages are still limited and there are few viable tools for clinical practice. thus a clinical score such as the ors sbc combined with cacs is the most efficient way to predict the cad risk in moderate risk patients. 3.2.6. lipid targets in primary prevention for individuals with metabolic syndrome and diabetes mellitus statins are among the most prescribed drugs worldwide reflecting their fundamental role in primary and secondary prevention of atherosclerotic disease and the high prevalence of dyslipidemias. several randomized clinical trials rct and meta analyses such as the cholesterol treatment trialists ctt collaboration 14 solidified the indication of statins. among 21 rct comparing statin and 808 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 placebo with a total of 129 526 individuals followed for 4.8 years each 40 mg dl reduced of ldl c decreased the incidence of cv events by 12 and cad deaths by 20 . moreover the ctt analyses showed that a greater reduction in ldl c with the use of more potent statins had an additive effect on the prevention of cv events. findings of 5 rcts with more than 39 000 individuals combined showed that reducing ldl c levels in over 20 mg dl with a more intensive lipid lowering treatment can decrease the incidence of non fatal myocardial infarction by 19 ischemic cva by 31 and major cv events by 28 . the use of statins in patients with cad seems to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques and can even lead to their volumetric reduction 95 with an approximately linear relationship between the decrease in ldl c and the rate of cv events as well as between ldl c levels and the progression of the atheroma volume in carotid arteries. in parallel not only the dose of statin and the reduction in ldl c decrease cv risk but the period of statin use also seems to have a central role in reducing the risk for cv death and non fatal myocardial infarction. in the woscops study for instance the number needed to treat nnt with pravastatin after four years of follow up was 40 1 whereas after 16 years nnt decreased to 27 1.96 regarding lipid targets for patients in secondary prevention the scenario was redesigned after the publication of the improve it study97 with simvastatin and ezetimibe whose ldl c was 50 mg dl and the fourier study98 alirocumab a pcsk9 inhibitor which reached mean ldl c levels as low as 38 mg dl. based on the significant and consistent reduction in coronary events in two clinical trials currently the ldl c target is 50 mg dl there is no reason however in terms of safety to seek even lower targets either through diet statins ezetimibe or pcsk9 inhibitors. in a primary prevention scenario the reduction in vascular events is comparatively lower than in secondary prevention but it still is robustly cost effective in diabetic and non diabetic patients with cv risk 7.5 in 10 years.99 as revealed in the ctt meta analysis a decrease in ldl c by 80 mg dl with a mean starting ldl c from 130 to 160 mg dl combined with an effective statin regimen for about five years in 10 000 patients in primary prevention typically prevents 500 vascular events 5 of patients .14 although the duration of clinical studies with statins is relatively short 3 to 7 years patients with dm and ms will be subject to a metabolically unfavorable environment for the rest of their lives 10 to 30 years . assuming that 68 of causes of death in diabetic patients are cv related 78 it is reasonable to think that once the high vascular risk is identified based on the ors with or without cacs more aggressive therapeutic targets should be considered. no rct has investigated an ldl c target below 70 mg dl jupiter 100 in primary prevention. however mendelian randomization studies consistently support that lower ldl c levels including the 30 50 mg dl range were related to lower cv morbidity and mortality.101 furthermore a subanalysis of the jupiter study showed that the lower the ldl c level achieved 50 mg dl the greater the risk reduction in both diabetic and non diabetic individuals.102 3.2.7. aspirin in primary prevention the use of acetylsalicylic acid asa in primary prevention is a controversial issue but that seems to have recently reached a common denominator. in 2018 three rct provided an answer to this question the ascend 103 in diabetic patients the arrive 104 in non diabetic patients at moderate cv risk median risk of 15 in 10 years and the aspree 105 in patients aged 70 years or older. all three studies compared low doses of aspirin 100 mg per day with placebo from 5 arrive and aspree to 7.5 years ascend and collectively found 1 no difference in rates of myocardial infarction and acute myocardial infarction 2 no difference in cv mortality 3 no difference in all cause mortality in ascend and arrive and a small risk increase with aspirin in aspree and 4 greater risk for gastrointestinal malignancy among aspirin users in the aspree study probably due to early diagnosis . these data are consistent with a systematic review by the antithrombotic trialists collaboration 106 which included 95 000 individuals from six rct. the reduction in risk for vascular events ranged from 0.57 to 0.51 per year placebo vs. aspirin while extracranial and major gastrointestinal bleedings increased by 0.03 per year 0.10 to 0.07 . although observational studies suggest that the use of aspirin benefits primary prevention in patients at high cv risk 107 this result was not confirmed in subanalyses of ascend and arrive. even in patients at higher estimated risk for cv events aspirin provided no net benefit since it induced more bleedings in this subpopulation and the proportional decrease in vascular events was mild compared to that in individuals at lower risk.103 104 3.2.8. hypoglycemic agents in patients with diabetes mellitus despite the strong effect of glycemic control on microvascular complications among diabetic patients its benefits for the macrovascular disease were still a paradigm until recently. medicines such as sulfonylurea and insulin have limitations despite being very effective in glycemic control as they induce weight gain and increase the risk for hypoglycemia two major risk factors for the worsening of symptoms and prognosis in hf and cad. several rct tested these drugs combined with metformin by comparing intensive glycemic control and less aggressive targets. in a meta analysis with 13 rct and 34 533 diabetic individuals although the risk for non fatal myocardial infarction decreased with intensive glycemic control relative risk rr 0.85 95 confidence interval 0.74 0.96 p 0.001 there was no significant change in all cause mortality rr 1.04 99 confidence interval 0.91 1.19 or cv mortality rr 1.11 95 confidence interval 0.86 1.43 .108 809 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 on the other hand with the advent of new drugs that allow effective glycemic control associated with weight loss and minimal risk for hypoglycemia the paradigm of glycemic control regarding cvd was broken. in a recent meta analysis glp 1 analogs consistently reduced the incidence of cv deaths and non fatal infarction by 14 and 18 respectively.109 data from the studies leader liraglutide 110 sustain 6 semaglutide 55 harmony albiglutide 111 and rewind dulaglutide

percentage of individuals with a bmi 25 kg m2 rose from 28.8 to 36.9 in men and 29.8 to 38.0 in women.115 in brazil 52.4 of the population was overweight in 2014 with 17.9 of them classified as obese.116 according to data from the 2018 risk factors surveillance and chronic disease protection by telephone survey vigitel the incidence of overweight reached 55.8 and of obesity 18.7 among men over 20 years of age while for women these values were 53.9 and 20.7 respectively.117 in 34 years the prevalence of obesity increased over four times for men from 2.8 to 12.4 and more than twice for women from 8 to 16.9 .118 119 brazil currently holds the fourth place among the countries with the highest prevalence of obesity and the number of overweight adults will exceed those with low weight.118 there is a significant rise in overweight and obesity among children and adolescents regardless of gender and social status and a considerable proportion of these individuals will become obese adults. obesity has a multifactorial nature and is one of the leading factors to explain the growth in the chronic ncd burden given its frequent association with cvd such as arterial hypertension ah cva hf 120 dyslipidemias type 2 diabetes atrial fibrillation 121 122 osteoarthritis and certain types of cancer. also obesity is an important condition that predisposes the individual to mortality.118 119 in addition weight gain over time is associated with ms increased risk for cva and death in late stages of life.123 125 many patients who present some of these changes have hypertriglyceridemia and increased levels of plasma fatty acids stored as lipid droplets in the heart. intramyocardial lipids that exceed the storage and oxidation capacity can become toxic and lead to non ischemic and non hypertensive cardiomyopathy known as diabetic or lipotoxic cardiomyopathy.126 significant weight loss 5 of initial weight improves bp ldl c tg and glucose levels delaying the onset of type 2 diabetes.127 4.2. primary prevention according to the world health organization who an inadequate diet is the main risk factor for early mortality worldwide.128 therefore a healthy diet is recommended for everyone and the ability to prepare healthy meals has beneficial correlations with the consumption of equally healthy foods.129 however studies have shown a reduction in the habit of cooking in some countries which has encouraged health specialists to elaborate nutritional education strategies focused on nutrients and tools such as the proper purchase and storage of food and planning and preparing meals at home.130 also we emphasize that the biological moment that could prevent weight gain is of the utmost importance. in females the moment of greatest risk seems to be the reproductive age specifically during pregnancy and the first two years postpartum and the period post menopause.131 132 among children and adolescents prevention of excessive weight gain was expected precisely because the growth phase requires extra energy and the possibility of energy expenditure is higher compared to other life stages. these potential facilitators however do not seem to overcome the factors associated with obesity and those responsible for the epidemic growth also in these age groups and life stages.133 in this regard we underline the so called obesogenic environment that is the role of the food industry fast food chains advertisements tv shows movies and videogames leading to situations that keep the children more sedentary and subjected to excessive energy intake. the most appropriate interventions should combine environmental and behavioral changes.134 136 a study conducted with 422 adolescents with a mean age of 12.5 years compared students who practiced competitive physical activity daily for 2 hours with those from a standard school who have only one hour of physical activity per week. the percentage of overweight obesity in the first group was 49.8 and in the second 37.3 which reveals the high prevalence of this change in the two groups.137 a similar sample submitted to a multidisciplinary program of moderate intensity that could be easily incorporated in the daily routine showed positive advances in risk factors when compared to the control group.138 among adults studies show a decline in the consumption of rice and beans increase in the intake of processed products particularly cookies and soft drinks excessive consumption of sugar more saturated fats and insufficient intake of fruits and vegetables creating an environment with habits that do not favor a healthy dietary pattern directly associated with the increase in chronic ncd especially obesity.139 142 a recommendation from the 2014 dietary guidelines for the brazilian population proposes 10 steps for a healthy diet 1. prioritize natural or minimally processed foods 2. use oil salt and sugar moderately 3. limit the consumption of processed foods 4. avoid the intake of ultra processed foods 5. eat regularly and carefully 6. buy food at the street market 7. cook 8. plan the purchase of foods and preparation of meals 9. avoid fast food 10. be critical of food advertising. some other useful pieces of advice are 143 144 eat regularly throughout the day and at similar times every day to establish a healthy dietary pattern pay attention to food labels and choose products without trans and hydrogenated fats avoid soft drinks and processed juices cakes cookies sandwich cookies and sweet desserts give preference to drinking water between meals practice at least 30 minutes of vigorous physical activity on most weekdays or 40 minutes of moderate physical activity however individuals with a tendency towards obesity or with family profile should practice moderate physical activity for 45 60 minutes per day those who were obese and lost weight should practice for 60 90 minutes to avoid regaining the weight lost the practice of physical activities and exercises can prevent weight gain and obesity even in older adults. table 4.1 lists the recommendations on how to approach overweight and obese adults. 811 updated updated

when sbp 140 mmhg and dbp 90 mmhg and should be classified into stages 1 2 or 3 bp blood pressure dbp diastolic blood pressure sbp systolic blood pressure. 5. arterial hypertension 5.1. introduction ah is the most prevalent chronic disease in the world affecting approximately one third of the adult population. bp is maintained by several factors particularly the intravascular volume cardiac output peripheral vascular resistance and the elasticity of arterial vessels. among the various regulatory mechanisms raas involving the renal system has significant participation an imbalance in this complex regulatory system however can result in chronic elevation of bp levels known as ah. ah is one of the most important cv risk factors as hypertensive individuals present much more atherosclerosis leading to cva hf coronary disease peripheral vascular insufficiency and kidney disease.145 although we have efficient drugs with few adverse effects the worldwide control of this condition still leaves much to be desired since we are dealing with completely asymptomatic disease a fact that makes care adherence very difficult. according to the 7th brazilian guideline of arterial hypertension an individual is hypertensive when his or her sbp and diastolic blood pressure dbp are equal to or higher than 140 90 mmhg table 5.1 .146 figure 5.1 shows the flowchart for the diagnosis of hypertension. the genesis of primary ah is multifactorial with genetic and environmental influences. although the genetic mechanisms involved are still obscure there is evidence that children of hypertensive individuals have a greater chance of becoming hypertensive. however the environmental aspect has an essential role in the development of ah. as the individual ages the prevalence of ah increases significantly therefore detecting predisposing factors is important to prevent this critical cv risk factor properly. besides family history age ethnicity and insulin resistance there are also environmental factors related to the development of ah that can be modified such as obesity psychosocial aspects diet sodium intake sedentary lifestyle and alcohol consumption. 5.2. physical activity and hypertension epidemiological studies suggest that regular aerobic physical activity can be beneficial in preventing and treating hypertension as well as reducing cv risk and mortality. a meta analysis with 93 articles and 5 223 individuals showed that aerobic training dynamic resistance and isometric resistance reduce sbp and dbp at rest by 3.5 2.5 1.8 3.2 and 10.9 6.2 mmhg respectively in the general population.147 resistance training but not other types of training further reduces bp in hypertensive individuals 8.3 5.2 mmhg . regular physical activity of lower intensity and duration reduces bp less than moderate or vigorous training but is associated with a decrease in mortality by at least 15 in cohort studies.148 149 this evidence suggests that hypertensive patients should be advised to practice dynamic aerobic exercise of moderate intensity walking running cycling or swimming for at least 30 minutes 5 to 7 days per week. the practice of resistive exercises 2 to 3 days per week could also be recommended. also healthy adults could benefit from gradually increasing moderate aerobic physical activity to 300 minutes per week vigorous aerobic physical activity to 150 minutes per week or an equivalent combination of the two ideally with supervised daily exercise.6 9 the impact of isometric exercises on bp and cv risk is less well established. table 5.2 demonstrates the classification of physical activity intensity and the levels of absolute and relative intensity. table 5.3 shows the v goals to prevent and treat ah.

some psychosocial factors such as work and family stress depression anxiety hostility and type d personality as well as low socioeconomic and cultural status increase the risk for ah and consequently cvd and reduce the adherence to a healthy lifestyle and drug treatment. on the other hand cvd also increase the risk of manifesting these psychosocial factors indicating a bidirectional and robust relationship.154 moreover the prevalence of cvd and ah is higher in developing countries where the control rate of these diseases tends to be poor decreasing life expectancy and increasing the pathologies and frailties related to aging.155 several prospective studies and systematic reviews have addressed socioeconomic status showing that low schooling and income low status jobs as well as living in poor residential areas are associated with the increase in bp levels and consequently cv risk.156 157 individuals with mood and personality disorders present an increase in the incidence and worsening of the prognosis of cvd especially among those with depression or anxiety.157 similarly personality traits associated with hostility or distress also worsen the prognosis.158 the management of psychosocial stress with several existing techniques among them meditation music therapy yoga and slow breathing can be crucial in preventing and controlling bp. in general such techniques can mildly reduce bp levels in hypertensive individuals.159 160 5.4. diets that promote the prevention and control of arterial hypertension in 2017 the global burden of disease group considered unhealthy diet as one of the main as risk factors for premature death and disability.161 adjustments in the diet of individuals with normotension nt or pre hypertension ph have the potential of reducing bp and preventing ah.162 national and international guidelines recommend that all patients with ph or ah reduce their sodium intake and consume adequate amounts of fresh fruit vegetables and low fat dairy products.163 furthermore these documents emphasize the importance of maintaining body weight and waist circumference within the normal range.164 many dietary patterns have been proposed to prevent and control ah as well as maintain global and cv health. among the dietary models proposed with different levels of evidence and effectiveness to prevent and control ah we highlight the dietary approaches

and coenzyme q10 did not present a significant bp reduction.168 5.5. alcohol and hypertension the relationship between alcohol consumption and hypertension is known since 1915 when a pioneer publication reported this association.169 several epidemiological studies corroborate the almost linear and dose dependent relationship between alcohol and ah.170 the difficulty in determining the effect of alcohol on the development of ah is the difference in the quantification of the 814 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 consumption pattern and the varying alcohol concentration of these beverages. heterogeneous results originate from the influence of the type of beverage ingested volume consumed lifestyle intake pattern and socioeconomic status of the population studied.171 172 the intersalt study evaluated the consumption of 300 ml of ethanol weekly 34 g 3 or 4 drinks day and found a bp increase in drinkers compared to non drinkers.173 estimates indicate that excessive alcohol consumption is responsible for approximately 10 30 of ah cases.174 the aric study followed 8 834 individuals for eight years and at the end of the investigation the patients with high alcohol consumption had a greater incidence of ah regardless of the type of beverage gender or ethnicity. moderate alcohol consumption was associated with risk of developing ah not only in african americans but also in the brazilian population.175 approximately 6 of all cause mortality worldwide is attributed to alcohol.176 when ingested in a single dose alcohol has a dose dependent biphasic effect characterized by bp reduction vasodilation and increase in hr with a subsequent bp elevation.177 in a study using the ambulatory blood pressure monitoring abpm in pre menopausal women the group who consumed 20 300 ml of red wine day 146 218 g of alcohol week showed a significant increase in bp.178 the same situation occurred in normotensive men who ingested an average of 40 g day of ethanol compared to the group who did not consume alcohol for four weeks.179 a meta analysis with 15 rcts involving 2 234 participants assessed the effects of reducing the consumption of ethanol on bp and estimated that a 2 mmhg reduction in dbp could decrease the prevalence of ah by 17 the cad risk by 6 and the ischemic cva and transient ischemic attack by 15 .180 5.6. weight loss and prevention of arterial hypertension overweight is recognized as a factor related to bp elevation and the greater the bmi the higher risk for ah.181 central obesity and weight gain over time stand out as important factors for the development of ah. the nurses health study revealed that women who gained 5.0 to 9.9 kg and those who gained more than 25 kg in 18 years of follow up had a higher risk for ah 1.7 and 5.2 respectively. however estimates suggest that only 26 to 40 of ah cases are attributable to overweight emphasizing the multifactorial nature of ah.182 weight loss as a non pharmacological approach reduces bp in normotensive individuals and can prevent the development of ah. changes in lifestyle are crucial for weight loss focusing on the adoption of a hypocaloric diet and regular pa with the reduction in caloric intake being more important than following specific diets.183 regular isolated pa without a concomitant dietary approach rich in fruits vegetables grains seeds nuts fish and dairy products and poor in meats sugars and alcohol in general is not enough for a significant weight loss.184 a meta analysis of controlled studies with 4 184 individuals showed a reduction in sbp and dbp of 1.05 and 0.92 mmhg respectively for each 1 kg of weight lost. in healthy obese individuals the combination of a low calorie diet and bmi reduction was associated with an average decrease of 4.73 2.75 mmhg in sbp and dbp.185 a systematic review of studies with hypertensive subjects showed that the magnitude of bp reduction with weight loss was on average 4.5 3.2 mmhg for sbp and dbp respectively underlining that the greater the weight loss the higher the bp reduction.186 the framingham study revealed a reduction in the risk of developing ah of 22 to 26 in individuals aged 30 49 and 50 65 years respectively who maintained a weight loss of 6.8 kg in 8 years. in this context regular pa stands as a measure of great importance in the maintenance of weight loss.187 5.7. low sodium diet in the prevention of arterial hypertension prospective cohort studies have demonstrated that high sodium intake increases the risk of death and cv events. these studies also reported that decreasing sodium intake to below a certain value approximately 3 g of sodium per day further reduced bp. paradoxically low sodium intake was associated with an increased cv risk and risk of all cause mortality in the general population and hypertensive individuals suggesting a j curve phenomenon. the mechanism of this apparent increased risk with low sodium intake is probably related to higher activity in the renin angiotensin system under a very high restriction of salt in the diet. no epidemiological study has evidenced that very low sodium intake can be harmful.10 on the other hand there is evidence of a causal relationship between sodium intake and an increase in bp. excessive sodium intake 5 g of sodium per day increases bp and is associated with a higher prevalence of systolic ah with aging.188 many studies have shown that sodium restriction decreases bp. a meta analysis revealed that a reduction of 1.75 g of sodium per day 4.4 g of salt day was associated with an average decrease of 4.2 and 2.1 mmhg in sbp and dbp respectively with a more pronounced effect in hypertensive individuals 5.4 and 2.8 mmhg. the reducing effect of sodium restriction on bp is more significant in black people older adults and individuals with dm ms and chronic kidney disease ckd .164 in western populations such as the brazilian the usual sodium intake is estimated between 3.5 to 5.5 g day which corresponds to 9 to 12 g of salt per day with marked differences among countries or even regions.189 sodium intake should be limited to approximately 2.0 g day equivalent to about 5.0 g of salt per day in the population in general but especially in hypertensive individuals. the effective reduction of salt is not easy and information about which foods have high levels of salt is often scarce. it is crucial that the population pay very careful attention to the amount of salt added to meals and with foods high in salt processed products . reducing salt intake remains a public health priority but it requires a combined effort between the food industry governments and the general population since 80 of the salt consumed originates from processed foods. the adequate consumption of fruits and vegetables enhances 815 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of

taken in the doctor s office the recommended bp target is 130 80 mmhg for individuals with stages 1 and 2 hypertension at low and moderate cv risk and those with stage 3 hypertension at low moderate and high cv risk.146 this recommendation is based on meta analyses of randomized studies 193 194 which demonstrated the superiority of this bp target compared to values above 150 90 mmhg. decreasing this target to 130 80 mmhg seems to be safe in this lower risk population as observational195 and some randomized studies corroborate 194 196 although the additional benefit is relatively small and counterbalanced by the risk for symptomatic hypotension and adverse effects of drugs. on the other hand individuals with stages 1 and 2 hypertension at high or very high cv risk or with three or more risk factors and or ms and or target organ damage should have bp levels 130 80 mmhg.146 in the sprint study 197 among the 9 361 non diabetic individuals at high cv risk median of 24.8 in 10 years 39 met the criteria for ms. the study population was randomized for a more 120 mmhg and less intense 140 mmhg reduction in sbp automated bp measurement on average 10 mmhg lower than the sbp measured at the doctor s office with a non automated method . among patients with ms the reduction in the primary outcome comprising acute coronary syndromes cva hf or cv death was similar to that of patients without ms after 3.26 years of follow up. the most intense sbp treatment arm presented a decrease of 25 in the risk of primary outcome compared to that with less intense reduction hr 0.75 95 confidence interval 0.57 0.96 p 0.001 .198 199 among patients with coronary disease the recommended bp target should be between 130 x 80 and 120 x 70 mmhg particularly avoiding a dbp below 60 mmhg due to the risk for coronary hypoperfusion myocardial damage and cv events.146 a j curve has been consistently identified in this population with sbp 120 mmhg and dbp 70 mmhg being associated with higher mortality.200 6. vitamins and omega 3 fatty acids 6.1. introduction several observational studies have found a strong association between the consumption of grains fruits and vegetables foods rich in vitamins and minerals and low cv mortality201 and lower risk for myocardial infarction.202 given this strong evidence numerous intervention studies have tested the impact of supplementation with micronutrients vitamins and certain fatty acids omega 3 series on primary and secondary prevention of cv events. from a practical point of view most of these studies showed no clinical benefit related to supplementation in the doses studied and in the face of the drug therapies used to prevent cv. tables 6.1. to 6.3 summarize the recommendations for and against the use of these supplements. 6.2. carotenoids carotenoids are a class with over 600 compounds responsible for the yellow red and orange pigments in plants with carotene carotene cryptoxanthin lycopene lutein and zeaxanthin being the most commonly found in food. known primarily as precursors of vitamin a carotenoids are also essential suppressors of free radicals and act as potent antioxidants.203 the evidence for the role of carotenoids in cvd originated from studies showing that increased consumption of fruits and vegetables was associated with a lower risk for cvd.204 a series of retrospective and prospective longitudinal studies identified an inverse association between carotenoid intake and risk for cvd.204 however the effect of carotenoids is complex and probably does not result from a single isolated compound. in contrast prospective randomized studies showed no benefit of carotenoid supplementation for cvd.204 205 corroborating this information a cross sectional analysis consisting of 894 members of the cohort study kardiovize revealed that the consumption of foods containing vitamins carotene zinc selenium and vitamins a and c was associated with a reduction in the intimal thickening of the

antioxidant index to categorize the foods excluding individuals who used antioxidant supplements. therefore the use of supplements only with carotenoids carotene or similar compounds is not recommended. instead efforts should be directed toward increasing the consumption of fruits and vegetables rich in these nutrients. 6.3. vitamin e vitamin e is the main fat soluble antioxidant in the human body and is present in a complex of four isomers and tocopherol . the interest in the potential benefit of vitamin e for risk of cvd was related to its antioxidant capacity and the possibility of modifying oxidized low density lipoprotein ox ldl particularly involved in atherogenesis.207 however prospective randomized studies such as the atbc chaos gissi and hope showed no benefit of vitamin e supplementation for cvd.205 208 the effect of supplementation with vitamin e and vitamin c on alternate days for eight years on 14 641 individuals did not reduce the incidence of myocardial infarction cva and cv mortality in addition to being associated with an increased incidence of hemorrhagic cva.209 despite the solid molecular basis theory of oxidative stress and its role in atherosclerosis these clinical trials do not corroborate the use of vitamin e supplementation to prevent cvd. on the other hand consuming foods containing vitamins e a and c was associated with a lower risk for adverse cv outcomes as demonstrated in the hong kong cardiovascular risk factor prevalence study crisps a longitudinal study comprising 875 participants.210 thus the consumption of foods with vitamin e has proven to be more effective and safe and vitamin e supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd. 6.4. vitamin d vitamin d is an important precursor of the steroid hormone calcitriol which is crucial for mineral and bone metabolism. in addition it has other functions and supplementation with this vitamin to prevent and treat a wide range of diseases has increased considerably in the past decade.211 its two main forms are vitamin d2 ergocalciferol and d3 cholecalciferol . vitamin d3 can be synthesized by human skin cells after exposure to uv b radiation from sunlight. in the absence of sunlight the intake of vitamin d is crucial. vitamin d and dietary supplements are absorbed by the intestine and then converted into 25 hydroxyvitamin d3 25 oh d in the liver and 1.25 dihydroxyvitamin d3 1.25 oh 2d3 the active form of vitamin d in the kidney. zittermann et al.212 summarized the underlying mechanisms for the potential role of vitamin d in preventing coronary disease. they include inhibiting the proliferation of vascular smooth muscle suppressing vascular calcification down regulating pro inflammatory cytokines up regulating anti inflammatory

endocrine regulator of the renin angiotensin system. low concentrations of circulating vitamin d were associated with ah obesity dm and ms furthermore observational studies associated the deficiency of this vitamin with the risk for cvd.212 213 some ecological studies suggest that vitamin d has a role in cvd showing an increase in cardiac disease events according to the geographical latitude that is associated with lower exposure to solar radiation with the concentration of vitamin d decreasing with latitude. several prospective studies have investigated the association between plasma concentration of 25 hydroxyvitamin d and cvd indicating an inverse relationship between the concentrations of this vitamin in the blood and the risk for cvd.213 214 despite this evidence data from a systematic review conducted by beveridge et al.215 showed a lack of consistent benefit of vitamin d supplementation for the main markers of endothelial and vascular function.215 a randomized controlled double blind study that lasted 5.3 years tested the efficiency of daily supplementation with 2 000 iu of vitamin d3 cholecalciferol in 25 871 participants.216 the primary outcomes assessed were myocardial infarction cva and mortality from all cv causes in addition to secondary outcomes of cv events. vitamin d supplementation did not result in a lower incidence of cv events compared to placebo. the vida vitamin d assessment trial involved 5 108 participants in new zealand aged 50 84 years. in the treatment group participants received an initial dose of 200 000 iu followed a month later by 100 000 iu or placebo for an average of 3.3 years. the study found no significant reduction in cvd and mortality in the group that received vitamin d in comparison with the placebo group.217 although observational studies demonstrate a positive association between low concentrations of 25hydroxyvitamin d and the risk for cv events its supplementation is not indicated to prevent cv at the moment. however studies with an adequate design still need to prospectively investigate populations with prominent deficiencies especially patients with ckd and other doses of this vitamin.218 6.5. vitamin k the review prepared by the cochrane library could not assess the effectiveness of vitamin k supplementation in decreasing all cause mortality including cv and non fatal outcomes myocardial infarction cva and angina in depth because only one study met the pre established inclusion criteria.219 this study comprised 60 individuals aged 40 65 years investigated for three months and revealed that vitamin k2 did not change their bp and concentration of plasma lipids. the very limited results of this review highlight the lack of robust data about the efficiency of vitamin k in the primary prevention of cvd. however the authors declared that the evidence for this assertion was minimal. a recent systematic review and meta analysis registered as the prospero study analyzed the results of 13 clinical trials that evaluated the effects of vitamin k supplementation on cardiometabolic risk factors in healthy individuals or a population at high risk for cvd. the study found no benefit for plasma lipids inflammatory cytokines such as crp and interleukin 6 sbp and dbp both in healthy individuals and among those at cv risk.220 therefore the literature has no evidence to recommend vitamin k for cv prevention. 6.6. vitamin c vitamin c or ascorbic acid is soluble in water and a very effective antioxidant since it loses electrons easily. the free radical theory of the aging process clarifies its role in the progression of chronic diseases.207 the japan collaborative cohort study jacc 221 assessed food intake in 23 119 men and 35 611 women aged 40 to 79 years without a history of cvd and showed that the consumption of foods rich in vitamin c was inversely associated with mortality from cvd in japanese women. despite the beneficial effects of consuming foods rich in vitamin c shown in observational studies rcts do not confirm the efficiency of its supplementation in primary or secondary prevention of cvd.222 consequently vitamin c supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd. 6.7. b vitamins and folate evidence of a connection between vitamin b and cvd was demonstrated by the effect of these vitamins on the reduction of homocysteine.223 224 homocysteine an amino acid containing sulfur is a metabolite produced indirectly in the demethylation of methionine. prospective studies have shown an independent but modest association between plasma concentrations of homocysteine and the risk for cvd.223 some factors identified as associated with high concentrations of homocysteine are inadequate intake of folic acid and vitamins b6 and or b12 for this reason the growth in plasma concentrations of homocysteine can only be one follow up marker of an inadequate diet. other factors that might be associated with increased homocysteine include preexisting atherosclerotic disease consumption of coffee and alcohol smoking dm use of antiepileptic drugs or methotrexate renal failure rheumatoid arthritis ra hypothyroidism and cystathionine beta synthase and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase mutations. prospective randomized studies with a large number of cv events failed to show any benefit of folate and b complex supplementation in reducing homocysteine and preventing cvd.208 the disagreement between the results of epidemiological studies and clinical trials might be partially due to the inclusion of different populations and the use of folic acid fortified foods in some countries. folic acid or b complex supplementation is not recommended to prevent cvd.224 a recent observational study conducted in 195 countries reiterated the efficiency of consuming foods containing vitamins to prevent cv risk and mortality associating the mortality rate of cvd attributed to diet with low intake of fruits grains and vegetables.164 in conclusion based on current evidence a diet rich in vitamins must be encouraged however there is no indication that supplementation with these compounds can prevent cv events. 6.8. omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of marine origin docosahexaenoic acid and eicosapentaenoic acid omega 3 fatty acids of marine origin docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa produce numerous effects on different physiological and metabolic 819 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 aspects that can influence the chance of developing cvd.225 226 despite the general agreement that regular consumption of fish rich in omega 3 fatty acids is part of a healthy diet recommending dietary supplementation with fish oil capsules is controversial fostered by conflicting results of clinical studies.32 227 229 6.9. effects of omega 3 on the lipid profile clinical studies show that 2 to 4 grams of epa dha supplementation per day can reduce tg levels by up to 25 to 30 slightly increase hdl c 1 to 3 and raise ldl c by 5 10 .32 the ability to decrease tg levels depends on the dose with a reduction of approximately 5 to 10 for each 1 g of epa dha consumed per day which can be higher in individuals with greater baseline tg concentrations. these data show that high doses of omega 3 supplementation can be used to treat hypertriglyceridemia. 6.10. omega 3 and cardiovascular outcomes in a meta analysis of 36 rct supplementation with fish oil median dose of 3.7 g day reduced sbp by 3.5 mmhg and dbp by 2.4 mmhg.230 the decrease in adrenergic tonus and systemic vascular resistance is a proposed mechanism. although several old pieces of evidence suggest a protective effect of fish and omega 3 fatty acids of marine origin on cv events 230 particularly in individuals with established cvd more recent studies showed no benefit of omega 3 supplementation for subjects who had or had not presented manifestations of atherosclerotic disease.227 228 in fact a meta analysis of 10 studies involving 77 917 individuals both in secondary 64 with prior coronary disease 28 with prior cva and primary prevention 37 of diabetic individuals failed to show any benefit of omega 3 supplementation epa doses ranging from 226 to 1 800 mg day and dha from 0 to 1 700 mg d after a mean follow up of 4.4 years presenting 6 273 coronary events 2 695 coronary deaths .231 these results were confirmed in an extensive systematic review and meta analysis by the cochrane group with more than 119 000 individuals from 79 randomized studies.232 also the same meta analysis did not find the benefit of supplementation with alpha linolenic acid ala the plant omega 3. possible reasons for the divergent results between old and contemporary studies concern the profile of the population studied mainly regarding the more frequent use of medicines known as protectors e.g. statins beta blockers acei the more aggressive control of traditional risk factors and the higher number of myocardial revascularization procedures in more recent studies. another difficulty in analyzing studies with omega 3 supplementation is the diversity in its composition and the lack of control regarding the intake of omega 3 in the diet. more recently two published clinical trials used low doses up to 1 g day of epa dha of omega 3 in primary prevention of cvd. one of them has assessed the role of omega 3 in the primary prevention of cvd and cancer among men over 50 years of age and women over 55 years of age vital study .233 using a formulation containing 460 mg of epa and 380 mg of dha the study included 25 871 patients with a median follow up of 5.3 years and found no benefit of omega 3 in reducing major cv event or invasive cancer.233 another study on primary prevention but in diabetic patients also examined the combination of epa dha in the same composition of the vital study. it included 15 480 diabetic patients followed for an average of 7.4 years and found no benefit of omega 3 in reducing major vascular event.234 thus the role of omega 3 fatty acids in the doses used with respect to the primary prevention of cv events is questionable. the reduction of cardiovascular events with icosapent ethyl intervention trial reduce it 33 tested omega 3 in the reduction of cv outcomes among patients with hypertriglyceridemia and established cvd or diabetic patients with an additional risk factor. the patients received highly purified epa icosapent ethyl at a dose of 4 g day. the study included 8 179 patients who used statins and had tg ranging from 135 to 499 mg dl median of 216 mg dl and a median ldl c of 74 mg dl. the median reduction was 18 for tg and 6.6 for ldl c in the epa group. reduce it showed a relative decrease of 25 in composite cv outcomes among patients who received epa and an absolute risk reduction of 4.8 nnt of 22 patients to prevent an event. the hierarchical analysis demonstrated a significant decrease of 20 in cv mortality. on the other hand the risk of hospitalization for atrial flutter or fibrillation presented a relative increase of 67 1 absolute with the treatment. the reduction of events in the reduce it study is similar to the results of the japan epa lipid intervention study jelis in which 1.8 g day of epa also led to a significant decrease in cv events among individuals who already used low doses of statins.227 however the results of this last study are limited by their open design and lack of a placebo group. data from these studies suggest that high doses of epa 4 g can be used in patients with prior cvd and who remain with elevated tg levels despite taking statins to prevent cvd. however there is no evidence for the use of lower doses and other formulations of omega 3 for cv prevention both primary and secondary. we emphasize however that several studies are still testing moderate to high doses of epa and epa dha in individuals at high risk for cvd who present persistent moderately high tg. 6.11. omega 3 in heart failure the gissi heart failure gissi hf trial evaluated the role of omega 3 in hf.235 this study randomized patients with chronic hf functional class ii iv of different etiologies to receive 1 g of omega 3 epa dha n 3 494 or placebo n 3 481 per day.235 the primary outcome was time to death and time to death or hospitalization for cv causes. during a median follow up of 3.9 years the omega 3 group presented lower mortality rate 27 versus 29 hr 0.91 95 confidence interval 0.83 0.99 p 0.041 with nnt 56 and lower incidence of primary outcome 57 versus 59 hr 0.92 95 confidence interval 0.84 0.99 p 0.009 with nnt 44 .235 data from this study however need to be confirmed. 820 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 6.12. omega 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids of plant origin ala has shown inconsistent effects on lipid levels.236 237 a systematic review and meta analysis of 14 randomized controlled trials with ala supplementation found no significant influence on tc ldl c or tg and only a minimal effect on hdl c a 0.4 mg dl reduction .238 specifically the effects of linseed on experimental animals range from zero to a slight lipid decrease and a review suggested a reducing impact on tg due to humans consuming large amounts of linseed oil.238 observational studies indicate a modest reduction in the risk for cvd with the consumption of ala.238 data from the alpha omega study showed no benefits of ala supplementation in preventing cvd among individuals who had a prior cvd. more recent data from the cochrane group meta analysis suggest that increasing the intake of ala probably makes little or no difference in all cause mortality cv mortality and coronary events.232 its effects on cva are unclear. however the authors recognize the low quality of most studies therefore further studies on ala supplementation are necessary to prove or refute its effectiveness in preventing cvd. we can conclude that at the moment there is no evidence to recommend ala supplementation to prevent cvd. table 3.3 presents the recommendations for ala consumption and supplementation. 7. smoking 7.1. introduction smoking control in brazil has been considered as a model not only for its programming but for the results with tobacco use being reduced by at least half when compared to the last decades of the 1900s. increased cost effective taxes a ban on advertising a ban on indoor use smoke free laws the sale of tobacco products to minors discussion of the subject in the school curriculum and warnings and information about harmful effects of smoking on schools universities the media and on cigarette packs themselves were effective measures to reduce smoking. there are currently over one billion smokers in the world. brazil is considered one of the countries in the world that has most reduced the prevalence of smokers in the last thirty years. in 1989 about 32 of the population over the age of 15 were smokers according to the national health and nutrition survey of the brazilian institute of geography and statistics ibge . in 2018 the vigitel survey of the ministry of health through a telephone survey in 27 brazilian cities found a frequency of adult smokers over 18 years of age of 10.1 being higher in males 13.2 and lower in females 7.5 . the highest frequencies were found in men between the cities of curitiba and porto alegre 17.3 and s o paulo 15.6 .239 for the cv system continued long term use of tobacco and its derivatives leads to the onset of chronic diseases which will manifest around 30 years after the start of regular smoking. as most smokers become addicted to nicotine before age 18 the health consequences are disastrous given the long exposure of the body to the harmful components contained in cigarettes. therefore prevention is the key to this health catastrophe. smoking prevention despite worldwide tobacco control efforts the number of nicotine addicts is still substantial. effective public policies against the sale advertising and use of cigarettes in public areas are important tools in primary prevention as they prevent non smokers especially children and adolescents from being exposed to nicotine. therefore the experimentation rate should be reduced in young people under 15 years of age. this initiative will surely reduce the number of potential tobacco users. primordial prevention of smoking primordial prevention of smoking is understood to be established before the initiation of smoking. it first identifies the risk factors for smoking with a wide range from the individual s own vulnerability such as the surrounding social determinants. providing a personalized and continuing education and enabling information exchange requires the formation of a multidisciplinary team.240 the aim of this team is to work with individuals and their families on the risks of smoking to outline strategies to prevent them from smoking and to promote health.241 242 factors that contribute to starting smoking 1. attitudes and beliefs a study of adolescents243 showed that 40 of those who had never smoked became experimenters and that 8 had a smoking habit for 4 consecutive years.244 the lack of a firm decision not to smoke was the strongest predictor of experimenting 2. influence of friends and family the presence of smokers among family and friends is an important predictor of tobacco initiation during adolescence refusing a cigarette in the face of social pressure is a challenge for most teenagers and only 44 of them can refuse a cigarette at a party 245 3. age both positive and negative attitudes towards smoking are more pronounced in adolescence 246 4. false conception adolescents tend to overestimate the frequency of smoking among adults247 and to underestimate their own 248 5. advertinsing magazines and movies are main advertising sources promoting adolescent smoking 6. nicotine dependence nicotine is a highly addictive substance and many individuals develop dependence after a few days or weeks of exposure.249 young people are more vulnerable than adullts to nicotine dependence 250 7. other risk factors depression the majority of studies show a relation between the presence of depression and the initiation of smoking allthough it is not clear if the association is causal poor school performance missing classes and poor school performance are associated with initiation and continuation of smoking 251 252 253 adverse experiences separation of parents or divorce physical emotions emotional physical or sexual abuse growing up among family members who are addicted mentally ill or imprisoned 254 255 substance abuse there is a high frequency of smokers among adolescents who use illicit drugs 256 so every 821 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 adolescent who smokes should be considered potentially engaged in other risky behaviors. 7.2. strategies in combating smoking initiation257 258 one way to approach primordial prevention is by age groups observing for each group five main items 5 as group 0 to 4 years ask parents and other family members about their smoking habits advise to keep the environment free of cigarette smoke the message should include information about the risks to parents and children as well as the importance of the parental model assess willingness to cooperate between parents and other family members assist parents with trying to quit by informing them about self help material and or referring them to their own doctors make an appointment with clinic within 3 months if a relative is a smoker check parental progress at each subsequent pediatric visit. 5 to 12 years old group ask children about how they feel when someone is smoking nearby and what they do about it if they think it is dangerous to try smoking and if they think they will smoke when they are older if they have tried smoking or if they have friends who smoke advise children not to try smoking praise them for remaining a non smoker and or staying away from cigarette smoke remind children about the short term negative effects of tobacco such as reduced ability to smell and athletic capacity as well as personal health risks e g. asthma exacerbation advise parents to quit smoking and to give clear anti smoking information to their children assess the risk factors of smoking initiation or regular smoking progression including level of experimentation smoking among friends depressive symptoms school performance and adverse experiences help parents in trying to quit smoking assist children with developing skills to refuse smoking and exposure to it assist parents in efforts to prevent tobacco use by their children through parenting and firm anti smoking messages make an appointment with clinic within 1 2 months for any child who is smoking or has worrisome risk factors for smoking refer as necessary cases of social or learning difficulties and mental disorders as well. group of adolescents and young adults ask adolescents about smoking behavior confidentially about friends who smoke and about light cigarettes advise adolescents to stop smoking reinforcing personal health risks and danger of addiction commend adolescents who are not smoking and remind them about the health risks assess the motivation and symptoms of tobacco dependence among adolescents who are smoking assess risk factors for smoking initiation among non smokers assist adolescents who are smoking with trying to quit including nicotine replacement and referring if necessary help parents with their efforts to prevent smoking initiation among their children through parenting and firm anti smoking information make an appointment with clinic within one month for each teenager who is smoking supporting attempts to quit or assessing motivation and barriers to quitting refer as necessary if risk factors are identified such as social or learning difficulties or findings of mental disorders. primordial prevention of cvd in its broadest context it involves avoiding the establishment of modifiable cvd risk factors including smoking and effective strategies for promoting cv health of the individual and the population. therefore the joint action of interdiscipline teams doctors nurses psychologists physical educators educators nutritionists social workers communicators managers and intersectoral family school government society specialists university teams is necessary in a continuous and simultaneous way. 7.3. how to treat smoker s psychological dependence nicotine addiction is a highly complex process that should be addressed by all health professionals. every healthcare professional especially the doctor during consultations as well as the multidisciplinary team should ask if the patient is a smoker. this question is essential. if the patient is a smoker two types of approach can be used. basic approach where the goal is to ask if you smoke to evaluate the smoker s profile to advise to quit smoking to prepare for cessation and to accompany the smoker to the cessation of smoking. this approach should always be performed by the physician during the routine consultation with an average duration of 3 minimum to 5 maximum minutes with each contact the patient makes. the patient should be questioned and asked systematically at each consultation and feedback on the evolution of the cessation process. suitable for all smokers. meta analysis involving 29 studies showed that cessation rates were 19.9 for those who underwent medical intervention.259 specific intensive approach performed by health professionals available and trained to make a more in depth follow up with the patient including the doctor. in this case the professional should have a structured program available to the patient with scheduled sessions 8 group individual sessions and will use national reference medication for treatment of smoking as well as the cognitive behavioral approach. if possible the patient should be followed up to 1 year of treatment. the cognitive behavioral approach is a psychological approach that is based on working out the automatic thoughts that the smoker has and that lead him her to get a cigarette. these thoughts are often accompanied by emotion and behaviors associated with smoking. it is important for the patient to feel welcomed by the doctor to show empathy not to judge or condemn because of difficulties in smoking cessation. another aspect is that the better the smoker knows his her addiction profile the easier it is to work on ways to control smoking addiction.259 260 in the cognitive behavioral approach it is necessary to distinguish the patient s automatic dysfunctional thoughts example if i do not smoke i cannot think helping him to seek coping strategies for situations other than getting a cigarette. behavioral techniques most commonly used self observation control of stimuli or triggers that lead to smoking telephone computer alcohol bathroom car identification and learning of functional thinking patterns relaxation techniques deep breathing postponement and breaking of conditioning assertiveness training so that one can face situations where there is the temptation to smoke self instruction situations in which patients are taught to argue 822 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 with themselves about the situation that tries to induce them to smoke and problem solving so that patients are taught about appropriate ways to solve a problem situation.260 262 instruments that help in assessing and understanding the patient profile prochaska and di clemente scale for behavior change this scale provides a model that allows one to clearly and objectively evaluate which phase of behavior change the patient is in. quitting smoking is a dynamic process that repeats over time and has different stages. at each stage the individual uses different cognitive and behavioral processes.263 the authors propose five different stages in this process. pre contemplation is characterized by the absence of intention to change behavior. the individual does not perceive in this case the act of smoking as a problem. contemplation implies some awareness of the problem. it is perceived and there is an intention to change but there is no notion of when so there is no commitment. preparation is the pre action stage. there is a clear intention to change the individual already has some initiatives regarding change but the action is not yet effective. action is already a behavior change to try to solve the problem. the individual spends time looking for treatments and promotes changes that must be sustainable. maintenance is the stage at which such changes must be consolidated encompassing all that has been achieved at the action stage. the problem is that these stages do not occur sequentially in the process of change but rather in a spiral way that is the individual may be at an earlier stage and at some point for some reason regresses to an earlier stage. and then evolves again. when he returns to an early stage of pre contemplation he may relapse back to his previous smoking pattern. the individual can start the whole process again and be able to abstain once again. basic signs that indicate that the smoker is ready for change has less resistance asks fewer questions about the problem addiction asks more questions about change what and how to do it takes a resolving attitude feels decided makes more self motivational claims talks about life after change difficulties and benefits begins to experience some changes decreased smoking . motivational interviewing it is a viable alternative in the treatment of dependent behaviors within brief interventions as the initial impact seems to influence the motivation for behavior change. motivational interviewing employs a particular way of assisting in recognizing present or potential problems as well as in behavioral change aimed at solving such problems. motivational interviewing strategies providing guidance removing barriers assisting obstacles providing alternative smoking options decreasing undesirable aspects of behavior practicing empathy giving feedback clarifying objectives and actively assisting and taking care of relapse prevention coping with abstinence.264 fagerstr m scale this is an evaluation scale that allows us to determine the degree of physical dependence on nicotine. it should be used in the initial assessment of the smoker on arriving for treatment. if medication is needed it helps to determine which medication is best and how much to take.265 266 in this case it is noteworthy that the use of medication should not be considered only in cases where fagerstr m is 5. it is known today that a very low fargestr m means that psychological dependence is very high and in this case the medication helps in reducing withdrawal symptoms.260 reason for smoking scale this is a rating scale that allows us to check in which situations the smoker uses the cigarette. it has to do with physical psychological dependence and conditioning and helps to clarify to smokers the risk situations of their daily life. this scale assesses stimulation ritual handling pleasure in smoking tension reduction relaxation physical dependence habit automatism and social smoking. these items should be worked through throughout the smoker s intensive approach process.267 7.4. pharmacological treatment of smoking 7.4.1. secondary intervention smoking the cv effects of smoking are harmful so cvd is the leading cause of death among smokers.268 smokers with cvd should stop smoking.269 the safety of first line anti smoking drugs such as varenicline bupropion and nicotine replacement has been reiterated by clinical studies designed270 to answer publication questions that suggested there may be cv risk with the use of anti smoking medication.271 the cats study 270 among others proved that there is no such risk. thus respecting the contraindications of each product the use of these drugs should be encouraged so that the patient can really quit smoking as the drugs increase cessation success rates.272 the prescription of anti smoking drugs is essential for improving the effectiveness of smoking treatment as well as conducting follow up appointments and encouraging changes in patients habits and behavior.273 274 the main features of first line anti smoking drugs are 1. nicotine replacers chart 7.1 nicotine is primarily responsible for cigarette addiction and nicotine replacement therapies nrt have been used since 1984 to help smoking cessation. the forms of nrt currently used and available in brazil are transdermal and oral lozenges and chewing gums . both are effective in smoking cessation and are often used in combination and can double the rate of smoking cessation compared with placebo.268 275 2. transdermal nicotine effectiveness compared to placebo rr 1.9 95 ci 1.7 2.2 .

after meal with water between 150 and 250 ml to reduce nausea . adverse reactions the most expected side effect with this substance is nausea 30 of patients . this effect is minimized by taking the medication after meals and with a glass of water. less than 6 of patients discontinue medication because of this effect. other effects reported to a lesser extent are insomnia 14 headache 10 constipation 6 abnormal dreams dream recall and actual content and flatulence which in some circumstances require dose reduction 1 mg day but rarely cause discontinuation of medication. contraindications absolute terminal renal failure pregnancy and breastfeeding. dose adjustment in patients with severe renal failure see adjustment table . precaution for use caution should be exercised when using in patients with a history of psychiatric illness such as severe depression bipolar disorder and panic syndrome. although the causal connection has not been demonstrated and considering that smokers have a higher risk of depression and suicidal ideation 280 the us food and drug administration fda in 2009 281 warned about the possibility of mood swings restlessness and suicidal ideation among users of varenicline and is therefore not recommended in patients with non stabilized psychiatric disorders. in 2011 singh et al.271 conducted a meta analysis with some varenicline studies warning of possible risks of cv events among users. after careful analysis of the study it was concluded that a significant number of patients who used varenicline in randomized trials were not included in the meta analysis and did not present with any cv event.282 prochaska and hilton283 performed a more comprehensive meta analysis including all varenicline studies and found no risk of increased cv event in the varenicline versus placebo group. the safety of varenicline was assessed by rigotti et al. 284 when they analyzed in a randomized placebo controlled manner the efficacy and safety of varenicline in patients with cvd. the authors found no additional cv risk in the varenicline group. overdose toxicity nausea feeling sick vomiting. second line medicine 1. nortriptyline nortriptyline is a tricyclic antidepressant that blocks the reuptake of norepinephrine into the central nervous system. it is a 2nd line drug in the treatment of smoking. the fda has not yet approved its use for treatment because although its efficacy is similar to that obtained with nrt or bupropion there is a greater risk of side effects from the medication.268 281 the recommended dose is 25 mg day as a single dose gradually increasing to 75 to 100 mg per day. use is not recommended in patients with structural heart disease of any nature because of the risk of inducing conduction disorders and arrhythmia. 7.5. anti smoking drug combinations the effectiveness of first line anti smoking drugs is between 20 and 25 for nicotine replacement and bupoprione and does not exceed 35 with varenicline.268 thus we can imagine that out of 10 patients treated about 3 will quit and 7 will not. the combination of anti smoking drugs seems to be a reasonable application option to improve success rates. despite the increase in cost it should be considered that quitting smoking has an substantial cost benefit ratio so the proposal is perfectly viable leaving the perspective of dealing with the possible increase in side effects as the main factor to be managed. some studies with the combination of patches and oral nicotine have shown improved results. meta analysis of 9 studies277 that combined a nicotine patch with a nicotine rapid release drug gum spray lozenge proved to be more effective than a single type of nrt rr 1.34 95 confidence interval 1.18 to 1.51 . the combination of nrt and bupropion was more effective than bupropion alone in the meta analysis of 4 studies.277 rr 1 24 95 confidence interval 1.06 to1.45 . 825 updated updated cardiovascular

nicotine on the brain by blocking the neuronal uptake of dopamine and norepinephrine. it may be used in combination with nicotine replacement therapy with patch excellent option for subgroups of relapse prone smokers with depression after smoking cessation and for women and those with a high degree of dependence. success rates for smoking cessation range 30 to 36 therapeutic scheme start treatment 8 days before smoking cessation 150 mg in the morning for three days followed by 150 mg in the morning and afternoon at 8 hour intervals for 3 months which may be extended for up to 6 months. control blood pressure and if elevated the dose may be reduced to 150 mg day before stopping in refractory cases. reduce doses in renal and hepatic impairment to 150 mg day. monoamine oxidase inhibitors should be discontinued for up to 15 days before starting bupropion. use with caution or avoid in patients on antipsychotics theophylline and systemic steroids as it favors the onset of seizures contraindications absolute history of convulssions even febrile epilepsy brain injury electroencephalogram abnormalities brain tumor severe alcoholism anorexia nervosa and bulimia pregnancy

which may be extended to 6 months in cases without complete cessation of smoking or risk of relapse. varenicline is administered orally and does not undergo hepatic metabolism and it isrenally excreted practically unchanged adverse effects nausea 20 headache vivid dreams and weight gain. rarely mood changes agitation restlessness and aggressiveness because it is not metabolized by the liver varenicline does not interfere with concomitant use of digoxin metformin or warfarin. cimetidine may increase varenicline bioavailability it should be used with caution in patients with renal failure contraindication pregnancy breastfeeding less than 18 years old bipolar disorder schizophrenia or epilepsy the combination of varenicline and bupropion appears to be the most effective of all evidence b 285 however randomized studies286 of greater consistency need to be performed. 7.6. future proposals the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors has not proven to be an option for treatment of withdrawal symptoms 281 but considering how often depressive symptoms manifest during smoking cessation 285 with or without drugs 286 randomized trials to test concomitant use of this drug should be conducted to assess whether results are improving as nicotine has an action on monoaminoxidase a which is responsible for serotonin degradation among many other neurotransmitters which would explain the high frequency of this condition. smoking cessation with or without anti smoking medication. bupropion and varenicline have no action on serotonin explaining the higher frequency of mood disorders in drug users compared to those on nicotine replacement. we believe that this event is more likely to occur in varenicline users due to the high antagonist potency in the 4 2 receptor thus preventing nicotinic action even if the patient smokes. from this perspective the longitudinal observational study that evaluated the effectiveness of the combination of varenicline bupropion and sertraline287 had a better success rate among those that used all three drugs. these findings warrant corroboration through a randomized placebo controlled study so that there is indeed robust evidence of the benefit of these combinations as well as testing whether the use of serotonin reuptake inhibitors is confirmed as an ancillary strategy in anti smoking treatment in patients who manifest depressive symptoms during smoking treatment.288 289 nicotine vaccines 290 long awaited to comprise the therapeutic arsenal are still under study. they act by stimulating the immune system to produce specific antibodies that bind with great affinity to nicotine in plasma and extracellular fluids.nicotine bound to antibodies cannot cross the blood brain barrier because of its size the vicious circle of gratification for brain receptor activation is broken. the main brands under study are nic vax ta nic and nic qb . 7.7. nicotine electronic devices electronic cigarette heated cigarette pen drives these devices were launched in 2006 and have since been refined by their manufacturers to replace the 826 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 conventional cigarette. the industry of these products insists on seeing them as smoking cessation treatment arguing that smokers by replacing the use of ordinary cigarettes with these devices would reduce the risk of disease by consuming a product with less toxic substances. with this argument they are investing heavily in marketing and phillips morris one of the largest conventional cigarette manufacturers in the world is widely publicizing its strategy to stop producing ordinary cigarettes and replace it with heated cigarettes also an electronic nicotine release device without combustion.291 the marketing importation and advertising of any electronic smoking device including electronic cigarette and heated cigarette have been banned by anvisa national health surveillance agency since 2009 in brazil rdc 46 . the agency considers that there is no scientific evidence to aid smoking cessation meaning cessation as a treatment process for nicotine addiction or scientific arguments that actually prove reduced morbidity and mortality by tobacco related diseases in populations that have replaced tobacco use. although they contain less toxic substances than conventional non combustion cigarettes those present are not harmless and nicotine is a substance known to have cv effects and perpetuates the addiction condition.292 the impact of the use of these products on people s health is not yet known and although manufacturers are betting on their use as a harm reduction policy the concern is that there is an epidemic of consumption and a setback in encouraging smoking cessation worldwide. therefore who does not recognize these devices as a treatment for smoking and warns that they cause nicotine addiction just as much as regular cigarettes and looks forward to studies evaluating the impact of these products on morbidity and mortality.293 7.8. hookah contrary to popular belief that hookah is less harmful and less addictive than cigarettes research shows that both carry significant health risks and may induce nicotine addiction.294 295 the world panorama shows that the trends of hookah use are alarming and have shifted from being a social phenomenon among young people in some regions to becoming the beginning of a global epidemic.296 in brazil the frequency of hookah use in the brazilian adult population aged 18 to 59 years was determined in a population based cross sectional study using the 2013 national health survey pns . of the 60 225 adults interviewed 15 reported using any tobacco use with the frequency of hookah use being 1.2 95 confidence interval 0.8 1.6 higher in the male white and younger age groups with medium to high schooling and urban and southern and midwestern residents among those who tried hookah 50 used it sporadically 12.8 monthly 27.3 weekly and 6.8 daily. these results point to the need for supervision and educational campaigns on the risks of hookah use.297 7.9. conclusion pharmacological treatment of smoking should be considered as a secondary prevention strategy mainly aimed at reducing cv injury. smoking is a chronic degenerative disease and should be viewed by the cardiologist like the other common illnesses in their care routine such as hypertension and dm. defining criteria for choosing which anti smoking drug will initially be used for patient treatment is still a challenge for treatment guides and guidelines because of the lack of systematization of models to be tested. in clinical practice the choice of drugs is made on the basis of contraindications drug availability and price among other criteria. therefore systematically discussing criterion models for this choice becomes relevant and necessary for increasing the efficacy of anti smoking treatment. the high degree of nicotine dependence298 could be a factor in decision making as well as factors that identify subpopulations that benefit from any particular drug considering gender age pharmacogenetics299 genetic polymorphism of nicotinic dopamine and hepatic receptors among others. these factors are not yet known at this time. recommendations

physical inactivity which is strongly related to all cause and cvd mortality is highly prevalent in brazil and worldwide.301 302 increased physical activity is related to health gain better quality of life and greater life expectancy.303 307 therefore both in an individual and population based cvd prevention strategy it is of utmost importance to prioritize a strong fight against sedentarism and requiring the questioning of pa habits and encouragement of adopting a more active lifestyle should be routinely done at medical office visits.308 8.2. relevant concepts and expressions in physical activity pa is used as a broad term that includes both structured and unstructured forms of leisure sports transportation and domestic and work related activities. physical activity involves body movement with increased energy expenditure in relation to rest and can be classified in terms of intensity as mild moderate or high. physical exercise is defined as a subset of structured activities aimed at improving cardiorespiratory fitness balance flexibility strength and or power and even cognitive function particularly important in the elderly.309 thus physical activity physical exercise and sports are related but distinct terms and table 8.1 defines some concepts and expressions. there is a strong association of different levels of physical fitness components with all cause mortality and the occurrence of unfavorable cv events with inverse association i.e. the lower the physical fitness the higher the mortality 310 317 requiring preventive action focusing on combating physical inactivity as of childhood. who recently presented specific recommendations for children 0 to 5 years of age related to daily physical activity exercise and sleep times which considerably limits or restricts sitting time in front of screens.318 table 8.2 presents a classification of the profile of children and adolescents according to physical exercise.319 8.3. main acute and chronic effects of exercise the effects of exercise can be divided into acute and chronic.320 the acute effect is that which dissipates rapidly and may be immediate after a single session or last for up to 24 hours subacute or late acute effect . improvement in flow mediated response with respect to endothelial function is an example of the acute effect of a single exercise session. the chronic effect is achieved by repeated acute subacute effects and can be evaluated at rest even if long after the last exercise session. resting bradycardia observed in athletes of predominantly aerobic modalities is an example of chronic effect. repetition of responses can produce a chronic effect as in the case of decreased blood pressure. some of the main effects of exercise are listed in chart 8.1. 8.4. epidemiological rationale of the benefits of physical exercise in addition to aerobic fitness 312 315 321 322 other components of physical fitness are associated with prognosis with higher mortality associated with poor fitness. proven as a predictor of mortality in middle aged and elderly men and women.311 323 other studies on muscle strength and power have also shown associations with mortality.316 317 scientific findings support the previous recommendations of national324 328 and international guidelines329 that recommend the regular and combined practice of aerobic and resistance exercises. flexibility and balance exercises should be part of an exercise program especially aimed at the elderly. regarding pe the greatest benefit is when comparing sedentary individuals and those who engage in very little or no exercise since the positive impact of abandoning a sedentary lifestyle is very significant. however comparing the varying degrees of aerobic fitness on an increasing scale we realize that there is a continuous decrease in the risk of cardiac death 829 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 table 8.2 childhood and adolescence profile according to physical exercise adapted from balassiano et al. 319 score definition childhood adolescence 0 sedentary or very inactive sometimes riding a bicycle often dismissed from physical education at school. 1 little active normal frequency in school physical education and short and intermittent periods of sports or dancing. 2

sports activities on most days of the week. 4 very active and competitive participation most of the time in training and or sports competition or regular and frequent practice of predominantly aerobic exercise. table 8.1 main concepts and terms in the subject exercise sedentarism and health concepts and terms significance physical aptitude ability to perform activities and physical exercises expected for their age group gender and body which promote health survival and adequate functionality in the environment in which they live. it is divided into aerobic and non aerobic components muscle strength power flexibility balance and body composition . physical activity any body movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure. physical exercise structured and repetitive physical activity for the purpose of maintaining or optimizing physical fitness body aesthetics and health. sport physical exercises with variable energy demand involving rules and competitions and aimed at individual or collective winning. sedentarism it is a condition in which there is no regular exercise or frequent physical activity involving energy expenditure 2 to 3 times that at rest at work personal transportation or leisure. exerciser one who works out regularly. athlete one who simultaneously meets the following criteria a training in sports to improve performance b actively participating in sports competitions c being formally registered in sports organizations and d having sports training and competition as their focus of interest or way of life. and all cause death. the higher aerobic fitness the lower the risk is of total morbidity and mortality and cvd both in healthy individuals and in cvd patients.312 315 321 322 greater physical fitness and amount of physical activity are associated with lower risk of developing hypertension.330 in already hypertensive individuals pe reduces bp and better results have been found with aerobic exercise mean sbp reduction of 8.3 mmhg and dbp 5.2 mmhg . smaller but significant reductions also occur with dynamic resistance training.150 another useful and clinically safe strategy for bp reduction is based on manual isometric training.150 331 in patients with resistant hypertension those with over target bp despite the use of three or more antihypertensive medications exercise in warm water 30 to 32 c resulted in a more marked reduction in bp and should be considered when available.332 334 the effects of reducing blood pressure levels during exercise occur immediately after the end of exercise and last up to 24 to 48 hours. thus as with drugs this action in the cv system needs to be repeated periodically for the benefit to be chronically maintained. regular pe exerts a hypotensive action which adds to the effects of pharmacotherapy335 and may in some cases require reduction of medication doses. it has also been suggested that dyslipidemic individuals with higher cardiorespiratory fitness even without statin use have a lower cvd risk than those with poor fitness using medication. those with higher aerobic fitness and statin use have lower all cause mortality which reinforces the importance of physical exercise and greater physical fitness even in patients with optimized drug treatment.336 337 8.5. risks of physical activity physical exercise and sport healthy individuals have an extremely low risk of events due to regular exercise. a study of more than 20 000 physicians with an average follow up of 12 years found that the risk was approximately one out of every 1.5 million hours of exercise exposure during and within the first 30 minutes post exercise .338 thus the recommendation to be physically active is quite safe and the fear of exercise related problems should not be a barrier or justification for maintaining a sedentary lifestyle. this message needs to be widely disseminated to the population because the percentage of physically active individuals is very low in our country.339 for further information regarding sport and pre participation assessment it is recommended to read the recent update of the brazilian society of cardiology guidelines for cardiology of sport and exercise.328 8.6. recommendations for exercise and physical activity although a meta analysis has shown that simply stimulating the adoption of a more active lifestyle can increase physical activity levels 340 341 the physician s guidance should be for physical exercise to be in an organized and structured manner. 830 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline

minutes per week of moderate to high intensity exercise may provide additional benefit. however there is no scientific evidence for a clear delineation of an upper limit from which there would be a greater possibility of harm to a healthy individual.303 more recent studies have associated sedentary time such as watching television with higher all cause mortality cv mortality and the risk of developing dm.348 8.7. prescription for exercises exercises may be prescribed for their characteristics such as type aerobic muscle endurance flexibility modality walking running cycling dancing duration running time weekly frequency and its intensity tables 8.4 and 8.5 . previously sedentary patients may begin exercise at the lower end of the prescription and progress to higher intensities gradually over the following weeks. the progression should initially be made in the duration of the session and later in the intensity of the exercises. already physically active patients according to individual assessment can perform exercises at more intense levels aiming at a minimum of 75 minutes ideally divided into two or more weekly sessions. localized muscular endurance and strengthening or power exercises have been shown to be very beneficial for general health and for cv and musculoskeletal systems being of fundamental importance in patients with sarcopenia and or osteopenia. they should be performed at least twice a week favoring large muscle groups of the upper and lower limbs and trunk. they can be made using one s own body or using attachments such as free weights shin

physical activity. should be given to the execution of the movements so that technique and posture are correct. there are different protocols for resistance exercise from the number of exercises used per session from 6 to 15 when done daily there is a tendency to work a muscle group on alternate days ranging from one to three sets for each exercise and also in the number of repetitions from 6 to 15. when training muscle power the speed of execution should be as fast as possible in the concentric phase of the movement. in this case only 6 to 8 repetitions per exercise are used requiring only 20 to 30 second interval between each series to allow replenishment of the adenosine triphosphate atp and phosphocreatine stocks needed to perform the next series. this strategy also has the advantage of greatly reducing the time dedicated to resistance exercises which in many situations may represent the difference between adhering to the prescribed exercise program and not. flexibility exercises can offer osteomyoarticular benefits health related quality of life and prevention of falling in the elderly. by contributing to easier and more efficient joint movement they ultimately reduce the demand for oxygen in moving situations and thus benefit the cv system. in these exercises we seek to reach the maximum range of motion reaching the point of slight discomfort and statically held position for 10 to 30 seconds. flexibility exercises should ideally be individualized from specific assessments such as the.349 in general women tend to be more flexible than men and there is a tendency for a progressive loss of flexibility with aging. tends to be proportionally larger in shoulder and trunk movements. depending on the age range clinical conditions and objectives of the exercise program for a given patient other forms of 832 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 exercise may be included in the prescription such as motor coordination and balance exercises not to mention the numerous opportunities generated by more playful forms and exercise socializers such as ballroom dancing and tai chi chuan.351 352 performing assessments of aerobic and non aerobic fitness allows a more individualized prescription of physical exercise aiming to obtain the best results and through risk stratification and search for hidden abnormalities minimize the risks of exercise of any kind or intensity. the initial evaluation consists of anamnesis physical examination and ecg. more detailed assessments should be individualized with exercise testing or maximal exercise cardiopulmonary testing anthropometric assessment muscle strength power and flexibility. in the initial evaluation we can quantify the functional deficit against the desirable as well as set goals to be achieved. it is important to emphasize that even those with low initial levels of physical fitness can benefit from and become adherent to a supervised exercise program.353 it is also possible to obtain clinical and functional support for appropriate counseling on sexual activity based on the kitomi model proposed by brazilian authors in 2016.354 it is essential for commitment to be encouraged in the patient on reevaluation while measuring his her evolution and benefits obtained. 8.8. formal and informal physical activity encouraging referral implementation and adherence although health benefits occur with relatively low intensity activities resulting from informal daily actions such as walking climbing stairs cycling and dancing it is ideal that regular exercise formal activities also occur which provides greater gains. patients with heart disease also benefit from regular physical exercise ideally in the context of a formal cv rehabilitation program or supervised physical exercise . cv rehabilitation acts on major disease outcomes with proven effects by meta analyses of randomized trials reducing cv mortality reducing hospitalizations355 356 and improving quality of life. in addition cv rehabilitation is a cost effective treatment.357 358 a possible way to improve exercise counseling by health professionals would be to combat their physical inactivity as it has been shown that physically active people have greater knowledge about recommendations on prescribed exercises and can motivate more.359 in addition to direct medical practice there is a need for changes in public and private policies with the need for comprehensive strategies established through simultaneous actions such as increasing physical activity in school programs transport policies and systems that favor commuting through walking cycling and public transportation public education including public awareness campaigns sports organization at various levels school work community etc. with proposals that encourage and enable lifelong sports from childhood to old age. 8.9. final messages physical inactivity should be combated by increasing physical activity in its various forms both structured physical and unstructured favoring urban mobility with bicycle paths and facilitating travel through walking. there is a consensus that a good and plausible weekly goal for health promotion and cvd prevention is to engage in physical activity exercise sport for at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of high intensity. given the current stage of knowledge it can be said that any amount of physical activity is better than none and sedentarism is a worse possible situation the benefits of exercise seem to be greater with more exercise up to 5 times the minimum recommendation there is no consistent scientific evidence that more than 10 times the minimum recommended exercise is harmful to health there are no longitudinal studies relating heart disease to severe physical exercise when performed regularly in healthy individuals.303 360 9. spirituality and psychosocial factors in cardiovascular medicine 9.1. concepts definitions and rationale 9.1.1. introduction there are lines of evidence that demonstrate a strong relationship between spirituality religion and religiosity and the processes of health illness and healing composing together the physical psychological and social aspects of the integral vision of the human being. in contrast to the easy conceptual assimilation obstacles are observed mainly due to lack of knowledge of the concept and scientific outdating regarding the operationalization of the spirituality construct and the understanding of how to measure and evaluate its influence on health outcomes.361 spirituality and religiosity are valuable resources used by patients to cope with illness and suffering. the process of understanding relevance identifying demands and providing adequate spiritual and religious support benefits both patients the multidisciplinary team and the health system itself. about 80 of the world s population have some religious affiliation and faith has been identified as a powerful mobilizing force in the lives of individuals and communities.362 363 9.1.2. concepts and definitions definitions of spirituality typically merge with other constructs such as religiosity and the dimensions of psychological well being especially positive relationships with other people purpose in life and sometimes paranormal beliefs. conceptual heterogeneity has been widely recognized and for some authors spirituality has no clear definition the term being used inaccurately and inconsistently varying according to religion culture and time and therefore difficult to gauge.364 the meaning of the word religion has latin derivations that refer to rereading from scripture to re binding or even to 833 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 reelection back to a god inferring connections to deity other people or their beliefs and values. although the term religion in the past and in current theological erudition has been used to grasp the institutional and individual dimensions of experience contemporary references to religion increasingly imply institutional social doctrinal and denominational characteristics of lived experiences.361 according to koenig religion is an organized system of beliefs practices and symbols designed to facilitate closeness with the transcendent or the divine and foster understanding of one s relationship and responsibilities with others living in the community .361 363 365 religion is a multidimensional construct that includes beliefs behaviors dogmas rituals and ceremonies that can be practiced in private or public contexts but are somehow derived from established traditions that have developed over time within a community. religion is also designed to facilitate closeness with the transcendent and promote an understanding of one s relationship and responsibility to others when living in a community.365 religiosity is how much an individual believes follows and practices a religion. it can be organizational church temple or religious services or non organizational such as praying reading books or attending religious programs. historically spirituality was considered a process that unfolded within a religious context with institutions designed to facilitate the spiritualization of the practitioner. only recently has spirituality been separated from religion as a distinct construct in part because of the distancing from the authority of religious institutions in modern social life and the increasing emphasis of individualism on western cultures.361 more recently faced with the need to standardize a definition for spirituality in palliative care a group of interprofessional specialists in palliative and spiritual care has defined spirituality as a dynamic and intrinsic aspect of humanity through which people seek meaning purpose and transcendence and experience relationship with self family others community society nature and the meaningful or sacred. spirituality is expressed through beliefs values traditions and practices. 366 according to the study group on spirituality and cardiovascular medicine gemca of the brazilian society of cardiology spirituality is a set of moral mental and emotional values that guide thoughts behaviors and attitudes in the circumstances of intra and interpersonal relationship life. one can also add the aspect of being motivated or not by the will and be subject to observation and measurement http departamentos.cardiol.br gemca . we consider it important that spirituality be valued measurable in all individuals regardless of religious affiliation including atheists agnostics or even those with religious affiliation but without observing and practicing it. for some both atheists and agnostics while not believing or uncertain about god s existence still have a form of spirituality based on existential philosophy finding meaning purpose and fulfillment in their own lives. spirituality evokes concerns compassion and a sense of connection with something greater than us.367 thus spirituality may include religion and other universal views but it encompasses much more general ways in which these experiences are expressed including through the arts relationships with nature and others and for some through the concept of secular humanism. this emphasizing reason scientific inquiry individual freedom and responsibility human values compassion and the needs for tolerance and cooperation. 9.1.3. rationale and mechanisms a significant and growing body of evidence demonstrates an association between spirituality and religiosity and mortality indices quality of life with supposed mechanisms based on a huge range of biological and mediating variables varying according to the model of healthy populations or not . healthy forms of expression of spirituality and religiosity research development scenario etc.365 368 369 in an american cohort predominantly composed of christians 40 years of age and followed for an average of 8.5 years a lower risk of death was observed regardless of confounding factors among those who reported religious services at least once a week compared to no presence. the association was substantially mediated by health behaviors and other risk factors.370 in a 2009 systematic review spirituality religiosity was associated with reduced mortality in studies involving healthy populations but not in trials of the sick population. the protective effect of spirituality and religiosity was independent of behavioral factors such as smoking alcohol exercise socioeconomic status negative affect and social support. when compared to organizational but not non organizational religious activities it was associated with longer survival.371 in the women s health initiative study involving more than 43 000 menopausal women cv risk was highest in patients with private spiritual activity such as prayer bible reading and meditation. subgroup analysis suggests that this association may be determined by the presence of severe chronic diseases.372 it is possible that spirituality and religiosity will have little impact on outcomes once disease is established identified and treated and is more important in promoting resistance to health problems before they reach an advanced stage. it should also be noted that religious coping is often used but may have positive or negative connotations. negative religious coping such as passive acceptance of fatality and requests for direct intercession can be detrimental in contrast to other beneficial effects.371 more recently new cohort studies have made important contributions from the perspective of epidemiology and the associations between religious service mortality and quality of life. in the nurses health study cohort of over 74 000 nurses followed for up to 8 years both all cause mortality and cvd or cancer mortality were reduced by about 30 in women who attended religious services at least once a week compared to those without any participation.373 in this same population attendance at religious services was significantly associated with lower suicide rate.374 similarly the follow up of a large cohort of black american women showed a significant 46 reduction in mortality rate comparing attendance at religious services several times a 834 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 week with no frequency. on the other hand involvement in prayer several times a day religious confrontation or self identification as a very religious spiritual person did not correlate with mortality.375 this interface between spirituality and religiosity and health and illness processes is multifactorial and can in part be attributed to a behavioral self regulation determined by religious affiliation and participation with reduced consumption of alcohol tobacco and drugs reduction in the number of partners better transport food and access to health care. emotionally religious communion brings better positive psychology and social support and positive spiritual coping can provide more hope forgiveness comfort love and other benefits. in addition to behavioral aspects most studies demonstrate the beneficial relationship between spirituality and religiosity and the physiological and pathophysiological variables of many clinical entities including cvd. despite the great heterogeneity between studies better bp levels neurohormones and autonomic nervous system activation hr variability dyslipidemia cv risk atherosclerotic disease dm crp and other markers of inflammation and immunity have been observed.365 368 another way of understanding the scope spirituality and religiosity may have on clinically relevant outcomes including greater longevity is expressed in the direct relationship with telomere size in leukocytes.376 377 9.2. spiritual history and scales for measuring religiosity and spirituality the degree of spirituality and religiosity of patients can be assessed in spiritual history or anamnesis understood as the set of questions asked to the patient to share their spiritual and religious values to identify possible spiritual issues that may contribute to or undermine the therapy as well as feelings that are used in daily life in the life of relationship whether positive edifying or negative not edifying . it should always be patient centered and guided by what it expresses about its spirituality.378 at first spiritual anamnesis as an integral part of clinical history should be obtained from all patients seeking medical attention but especially those hospitalized with serious chronic progressive or debilitating illness. 9.2.1. why address spirituality and religiosity the approach to the subject is very important because many patients are religious or spiritual and their beliefs influence how to cope with adverse situations in life and may help to cope with the disease. during periods of hospitalization or chronic illness they are often removed from their communities and prevented from practicing their religious beliefs. in addition personal beliefs may affect health related decisions that may be conflicting with treatment.379 380 many health professionals do not know if patients wish agree with or are open to this approach. studies show that most patients would like their doctors to ask about spirituality and religiosity generating more empathy and trust in the doctor and thus rescuing the doctor patient relationship with a more humane care.381 382 9.2.2. objectives of spirituality and religiosity assessment it is essential to seek to understand the patients beliefs identify aspects that interfere with health care evaluate the individual family or social spiritual strength that will allow them to cope with the disease offer empathy and support help them to find acceptance of the disease and identify situations of conflict or spiritual suffering that will require evaluation by a skilled professional.383 384 in this evaluation it is essential to detect negative feelings that may contribute to the illness or aggravation of the condition such as hurt resentment unforgiveness ingratitude among others. 9.2.3. how to address patient spirituality and religiosity there are several ways to approach this issue and most importantly it should be done sensitively without promoting religion or prescribing prayers or religious practices. nor should the individual be coerced into adopting specific beliefs or practices. most of the time the approach can be taken naturally during the interview as the doctor assesses psychosocial aspects.365 patients should be asked about the importance of spirituality religiosity and religion to them if this helps to cope with illness generates stress or negative feelings guilt punishment etc. or influences treatment adherence or decisions and if there are any unmet spiritual needs. the health professional should be sensitive and welcoming to religious beliefs and practices. if there are negative feelings conflicts or spiritual needs the provider should solicit the participation of a trained individual or member of the patient s community to properly address these issues. in the case of nonreligious patients or those who refuse to talk about the subject the doctor may inquire about the ways in which individuals live with the disease what promotes purpose and meaning for their life family friends hobby etc. and what beliefs may have an impact on their treatment. for this approach to be non conflictive preparation and acceptance by both health professionals and patients is required. 9.2.4. scales and instruments for evaluating spirituality and religiosity measuring spirituality and religiosity in clinical practice and research is challenging given the complexity of the elements and definitions involved in denomination beliefs religious spiritual practices participation in religious communities support in dealing with illness forgiveness gratitude altruism spiritual well being pain or suffering and others. the various psychometric instruments can be divided into tools for spiritual tracking or for spiritual history collection.386 387 1. spiritual tracking evaluate the presence of spiritual needs that indicate deeper assessment. they are brief and easy to apply. some of the instruments for spiritual tracking are listed in chart 9.1. spiritual tracking provides important information and may indicate the need for further evaluation although aspects remain to be studied better time to apply in different stages of the disease and differences in cultural context among others . 835 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 chart 9.1 instruments spiritual

spiritual history they allow a broader evaluation of the different domains of patients spirituality and religiosity that may affect clinical evolution their attitude towards cvd self care and their physical mental and spiritual well being during the disease. they are well structured instruments addressing the different domains but they should be applied informally from memory throughout the conversation with the patient which serve as a tool or guide and should not be viewed rigidly but as continuous learning and consequent familiarization with the task of completing the anamnesis. there are several validated instruments for collecting spiritual history whether to evaluate spirituality and religiosity more broadly or for research purposes. 2. a. religiosity scales the religiosity index durel duke university religion index is a scale of five items that measure three dimensions of religious involvement 1 assesses organizational religiosity or 2 assesses non organizational religiosity nor and 3 4 and 5 consider the assessment of intrinsic religiosity ir chart 9.2 . validated in brazil 392 durel is succinct and easy to apply addresses the main domains of religiosity and has been used in various cultures. it has shown good psychometric characteristics face and competitor validity and good test retest reliability but does not evaluate spirituality. the dimensions of religiosity measured by durel have been related to several indicators of social support and health.39 2. b. assessment of spiritual history the assessment of spirituality involves a set of questions about its different domains that are associated with health outcomes based on previously validated scales. known by acronyms some of the main instruments are fica 393 hope 394 faith380 and spirit.395 among these the fica questionnaire has shown the best psychometric characteristics chart 9.3 . it was created by doctors based on clinical experience and can be used in different clinical situations. it analyzes four dimensions faith or belief importance and influence community and action in treatment has easy application fast execution and good memorization383 similarly hope has shown good performance in spiritual assessment chart 9.3 . studies evaluating the association of spirituality and religiosity with cv outcomes have been criticized for the difficulty in adjusting for multiple

understanding the pathophysiology illness and consequent medical intervention. some general lines can be established 1. take no action religious issues are delicate and not always objective to the point of plausible resolution even though they may be of great importance to the patient. often the best course is simply to offer your empathy and understanding 2. incorporate spirituality in preventive health the physician can encourage the patient to use his her spirituality as a disease prevention tool by engaging in activities such as prayer and meditation 3. include spirituality in adjuvant treatment the physician can help the patient identify spiritual aspects that along with standard treatment may help with the outcome of the disease in the case of serious illness the physician can collect the spiritual history and help the patient find meaning accept the illness and cope with the situation using his her spiritual resources in the best way 4. modify the treatment plan it is up to the physician to understand that the patient has the freedom to be able to modify the therapeutic plan on the basis of religious beliefs and thus to propose modifications in the course of the treatment. for example the patient may opt for meditation as an option for chronic pain change chemotherapy plans and seek community support. 836 updated updated cardiovascular

spirituality and religiosity are associated with lower prevalence of smoking alcohol consumption sedentarism pa better nutritional and pharmacological adherence in dyslipidemia hypertension obesity and dm.365 399 401 alcohol in many studies that examined the relationship between spirituality and religiosity with alcohol use an inverse relationship was found that is there were higher rates of spirituality or frequency of religious activity with lower alcohol consumption. according to the same authors several studies have shown that more religious individuals are more physically active. there is also a positive relationship between spirituality and religiosity and pa.365 among brazilian university students a higher prevalence of alcohol consumption smoking and use of at least one illicit drug in the last 30 days among those who had less frequent religious involvement.399 smoking in the cardia cohort study it was observed that religiosity was related to lower risk of subclinical carotid atherosclerosis and had a positive association with higher consumption of fiber vegetables and fruits and lower consumption of processed foods.401 402 obesity in both the mesa and cardia studies a higher association was observed between extent of religious involvement and higher propensity for obesity.401 402 compared to those who did not participate in any religious activity individuals with different frequencies of religious involvement were significantly more prone to obesity even after adjusting for demographic and smoking characteristics. diabetes mellitus regarding diabetes although they are more prone to obesity patients with greater religiosity had no higher risk of being diabetic. this may be explained by better diet or better treatment adherence.366 in contrast in the third national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes iii study there was no association between diabetes and attendance at religious services.370 hypertension regarding hypertension the results are contradictory. in the chicago community adult health study it was found that higher religiosity indicators were not associated with hypertension.403 in the prospective black women s health study after an 8 year follow up the greater involvement with spirituality and religiosity employed in coping with stressful events was associated with a lower risk of developing hypertension especially in women with higher stress.404 a national study involving a highly religious community found that the prevalence of hypertension among these individuals was lower than the national prevalence.405 meditation is one of the most studied interventions among practices related to spirituality and religiosity and the repercussions on bp levels. in these studies the magnitude of bp reduction varies significantly. studies have methodological limitations with data bias high dropout rates and different populations studied. in a systematic literature review transcendental meditation reduced sbp by 4 mmhg and dbp by 2 mmhg effects comparable to other lifestyle interventions such as weight loss and exercise.407 the mechanisms by which meditation reduces pa have not yet been fully elucidated. possibly the long term neurophysiological changes that occur with meditation may lead to changes mediated by the autonomic nervous system in bp. the impact of stress reduction on bp remains to be better defined.406 9.4. secondary prevention as with primary prevention secondary prevention should be viewed as comprehensive and taking into account psychosocial factors such as socioeconomic status depression anxiety hostility anger and type d personality that may aggravate cvd.2 in this context some of these factors should be highlighted as well as the results obtained with new proposals for intervention in the field of spirituality religiosity and related areas. forgiveness evaluated by various scales as tendency and attitude forgiveness determines multiple effects generating states more favorable to homeostasis in the emotional cognitive physiological psychological and spiritual aspects. forgiveness broadens the possibilities for behavior by building better adaptive strategies and counteracting the feelings of anxiety anger and hostility that are potent cv risk factors. it also reduces stress drug addiction and rumination improves social support interpersonal relationships and health self care.409 413 one study analyzed the effect of forgiveness on myocardial ischemia ischemia generated by stress and measured by scintigraphy techniques. patients were randomized to receive or not a series of psychotherapy sessions to develop interpersonal forgiveness. after 10 weeks of follow up the forgiveness intervention was able to reduce the burden of anger induced myocardial ischemia in patients with cad.414 gratitude in clinical practice gratitude can be assessed by specific questionnaires such as the gratitude questionnaire 6 gq 6 415 allowing the analysis of behavioral interactions and physiological pathophysiological and clinical outcomes. individuals with greater gratitude have a better cv health profile similarly to those with higher spirituality and religiosity indices. in asymptomatic hf patients assessed by the gratitude depression sleep gratitude and spiritual well being questionnaires the latter two correlated with better inflammatory profile and better mood and sleep quality less fatigue and greater self efficacy.416 psychological strategies that may increase feelings of gratitude such as regular journaling thoughts meditation and fact checking or grateful people have been studied demonstrating increased feelings of gratitude and reduced inflammatory markers.417 depression and resilience depression is significantly more common in patients with cvd than in the general community. this higher prevalence is often secondary to the disease as an adaptation disorder with symptoms disappearing spontaneously in most patients. however approximately 15 of them develop a major depressive disorder which is an independent risk marker of increased morbidity and mortality.418 419 in a cross sectional study including 133 patients diagnosed with ischemic heart disease assessed by the wagnild young resilience scale 81 were classified as 838 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 resilient suggesting that disease may act as a facilitator for the presence of this feeling.420 resilience is a behavior that greatly improves treatment adherence as well as quality of life and can be acquired at any stage of life regardless of age and disease state. spirituality and religiosity are associated with higher levels of resilience.420 421 in another series elderly patients 65 years were significantly more resilient than younger patients. resilience correlated negatively with depression and inversely with affective cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression and was responsible for greater variation in the affective characteristics of depression than in the somatic characteristics.419 in a long term cohort patients were analyzed for functional social support bmi recent history of major depression coronary artery disease hypertension and diabetes. after 13 years it was observed that social support was responsible for reducing the relationship between depression and the occurrence of coronary artery disease. specifically depression was prospectively associated with coronary artery disease among individuals with low social support but not those with high support suggesting that it may function as a resilience factor against cv risk associated with depression.422 the palliative care in heart failure study was the first randomized controlled trial involving palliative care to demonstrate the significant clinical benefit of incorporating interdisciplinary interventions in the management of patients with advanced hf. the addition of palliative care improved physical and psychosocial condition anxiety depression and spiritual quality of life.423 relaxation and meditation relaxation and meditation are well established mind body approaches to improving stress and their benefit has been demonstrated in many populations including heart disease.344.424 426 easy to learn and practical they are inexpensive and widely accessible techniques. in an observational study in patients with coronary artery disease the cardiac rehabilitation strategy associated with a 13 week program was analyzed using self relaxation spiritual well being and psychological stress control techniques. there were significant increases in relaxation practice time and spiritual well being scores as well as improvement in depression anxiety hostility and overall severity scores. a greater increase in relaxation practice time was associated with spiritual well being which in turn was associated with improved psychological outcomes.424 patients with coronary artery disease were enrolled in a transcendental meditation or health education program with an average follow up of 5.4 years. transcendental meditation significantly reduced the risk of mortality myocardial infarction and stroke these changes being associated with lower bp levels and psychosocial stressors. additionally a national study randomized patients with chronic hf to do meditation or not demonstrating a reduction in serum norepinephrine and ve vco 2 slope in the cardiopulmonary test and improved quality of life assessed by the minnesota living with heart failure questionnaire.426 a recent paper by the american heart association reviews various forms of meditation and highlights the prolonged effects observed on brain physiology and anatomy possibly responsible for better systemic physiological status and reduced cardiovascular risk. meditation shows a better physiological response to stress smoking cessation reduced bp insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome endothelial function inducible myocardial ischemia and primary and secondary prevention of cvd. although some data on cvd risk reduction are limited meditation can be considered as a complement to risk reduction and lifestyle modification.344 in a robust study involving 1 120 meditators other complex domains have been identified that may be crucial to people s psychological and spiritual development by acting as mediators and or mechanisms responsible for the effects of meditation. of difficult measurement relational and transpersonal aspects mystics and anomalous or extraordinary phenomena linked to meditation deserve further study. the extent of the possible effects to be obtained with each form of meditation remains open. transcendental meditation has been shown to reduce anxiety improve mood and to double the acute pain tolerance time when compared to secular forms of meditation.428 medication adherence in a cohort of 130 hf patients adequate adherence score was observed in only 38.5 of patients. spirituality religiosity and personal beliefs were the only variables consistently associated with adherence. it is noteworthy that depression or religiosity were not correlated with adherence when evaluated separately. when spirituality was assessed by both it was positively correlated with adherence adjusted for demographic and clinical characteristics and psychosocial instruments.429 cardiac rehabilitation several studies report improvement in psychological stress in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing cv rehabilitation. in addition a meta analysis of 23 randomized controlled trials involving 3 180 coronary artery disease patients seeking to assess the impact of adding psychosocial interventions to standard rehabilitation exercise reported greater reduction in psychological distress and improvements in sbp and serum cholesterol.430 the scope of cardiac rehabilitation can be amplified by positive psychology techniques. in patients undergoing coronary angioplasty these explanatory techniques with telephone contacts and inductive correspondence resulted in better physical performance caloric expenditure with a reduction in medical events as opposed to the effects observed by stress.431 in another meta analysis the influence of rehabilitation associated with psychosocial and or educational interventions in 14 486 individuals with pre established coronary artery disease with a median follow up of 12 months was evaluated. in general rehabilitation led to a reduction in cvd mortality and the risk of hospitalizations and a better quality of life.354 9.5. recommendations for clinical practice most patients and their families guardians or caregivers have varying degrees of religiosity and spiritual needs and importantly expect health professionals to know their beliefs and to be part of the decision making process reinforcing the concept of integrality. 839 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 health professionals involved should keep in mind that spirituality and religiosity favorably influence ability to cope with the disease but the isolation imposed by hospitalization may be negative as it removes patients from their religious meetings or practices from religious leaders and of dedicated communities. these beliefs and practices can impact and often antagonize proposed medical strategies. it is worth noting that health professionals also present their own profiles of spirituality and religiosity influencing their practice especially in severe critical or limiting situations. every professional should be aware of the relevance of screening involving spirituality and those focused on direct care such as doctors nurses and chaplains should have an anamnesis of spirituality and religiosity viewed not only as part of identifying where professed religion is concerned but how a broader construction obtained by structured or unstructured questionnaires allowing to penetrate and understand the true identity of spirituality and religiosity in patients and relatives.387 432 433 most professionals are sensitive to the demand of patients only when informed but the contemporary view is to actively search for this information and demands because the patient often does not feel comfortable discussing it.432 in a holistic view of a human being the anamnesis of spirituality and religiosity should be remembered in each care interaction and by all health professionals.366 433 naturally this approach may be unimportant or difficult to use in many situations such as in major emergencies but it is of enormous relevance in critical terminal chronic degenerative diseases or palliative care. critically ill patients have high rates of not only pain dyspnea anorexia and fatigue but also of anxiety nervousness sadness and depression. for this patient profile cicely saunders concept of total pain understood as a sum of physical psychological social emotional and spiritual elements must be valued and addressed in a systematic and structured manner even in the first days of hospitalization.434 435 patient centered approaches with a greater focus on spirituality make it easy to understand and value the motivations for consultation understand the patient s universe including emotional and existential issues and strengthen the relationship between practitioners and patients shared decision making and prevention and promotion of health.433 436 it is essential for professionals to be technically prepared and the patient to agree on addressing issues related to spirituality and religiosity so that the interaction is constructive and without conflict. in the absence of technical training or resistance to the subject by the patient the spiritual history should be postponed to a more opportune time or even canceled. when these alignments do not occur serious conflicts can develop and sometimes very deleterious to medical management. to avoid conflicts in the doctor patient relationship it should always be borne in mind that this area is deeply personal as well as intensely emotional and therefore the physician should not address emotional issues without proper approximation of spiritual and or religious aspects. the physician should be sure of the patient s agreement to address the issue. health professionals especially those involved in critical or terminal patient care or palliative care are subject to a significant burden of professional stress. this work involves a lot of compassion understood as an attitude of addressing the needs of others and helping those in distress which can be viewed as a spiritual practice. training and practice strategies on spirituality and religiosity in this setting can contribute to a better sense of meaning and purpose at work spiritual well being less fatigue and reduced burnout.366 the reasons for professionals not addressing spirituality and religiosity are diverse such as feeling uncertain about initiating spiritual discussions being misunderstood as imposing religion invasion of privacy causing discomfort difficulties with the language of spirituality.436 these justifications have also been identified in brazilian medical students437 and represent weaknesses in medical education and practice with specific ignorance or inadequate dimensioning lack of mastery of specific tools and training. the solution to these limitations lies in the development of hospital spirituality support and training programs. these programs contribute to well being and health improvement assist with misunderstanding in conducts and meet patients expectations and they are part of accreditation processes and prospects for reducing hospitalization costs.438 for the development of these programs there should be deep institutional involvement formal training of the teams most directly connected to care availability of infrastructure and resources adjustments to care routines and alignment with the various religious communities. health teams especially when acting in scenarios where there is a higher demand for spirituality and religiosity should be structured with systematic training and clear definition of responsibilities such as obtaining and recording anamnesis in medical records clarifying the observed demands and the implemented clinical course as well as the observed outcomes. at initial contact spiritual history can be obtained through open and brief questions by the doctor nurse or chaplain thus tracking needs and anticipating conflicts. for the spiritual approach no professional is expected to be able to do so but a certified chaplain or a spiritual care professional with equivalent technical training and structured standards and concepts to develop a spiritual care plan.387 religion should never be prescribed forced or even encouraged at the risk of adding guilt to the burden of disease. identifying the right time for spirituality and religiosity approaches is important to avoid any kind of misunderstanding always under the rule of common sense. we emphasize that the evaluation of spirituality is always desirable enabling the search for information in all patients regardless of religion or religiosity but the approach in extreme situations can lead to stress and even worsen patient evolution. respect for spirituality religiosity and individual beliefs is essential and should match the therapeutic plan if it is not harmful. if necessary and at the patient s wishes and in the face of risk or harm or in conflict situations the presence of religious 840 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 representatives or leaders can bring comfort balance and better management and can contribute to a desired consensus. the approach of spirituality and religiosity topics in medical consultation in an area such as cardiology where the patient is generally in a situation of fragility and more sensitive and stressful increases the complexity of the multiple variables already mentioned and may generate some conflicts. the misunderstanding or intolerance of the parties involved are major factors and can generate conflicts of various kinds and at all interfaces involving the patients their families and their relationships within the multidisciplinary team itself and between the team and the patient. all these problems can be prevented by good management of the doctor patient relationship which once consolidated will make all other situations less influential. conflicts can be avoided even for untrained professionals as long as some important steps are followed conduct spiritual anamnesis without prejudice showing deep interest and respect for the patient seeking to understand their religion beliefs and practices 363 encourage questions to help patients clarify their feelings and thoughts about the spiritual perspective of what is going on or even their possible spiritual problems.393 in questions related to spirituality and religiosity it should be kept in mind that it is always better to understand than to advise. concepts involving evidence based medicine have also been applied in the realm of spirituality but the available evidence is not always ideal and definitive. in these scenarios available evidence should be used to improve this practice also contributing to the revision of old concepts the development of new research and the advancement of science in the field of spirituality. in chart 9.4 gemca gathers recommendations that may be useful for improving cardiology practice in our country. chart 9.4 practices in spirituality

the last century humanity has undergone an epidemiological transition in relation to the causes of death infectious diseases are no longer the leading cause of death while chronic degenerative diseases especially cvd now take the lead. although they are still the leading causes of mortality worldwide from the late 1950s a decline in cvd mortality began in industrialized countries. in brazil this decrease in cvd mortality began to be observed in the late 1970s with a significant reduction in these rates despite significant regional differences.2 440 441 it is not possible to only associate the reduction in mortality due to cvd to the better control of classic cv risk factors such as diabetes hypertension obesity dyslipidemia and smoking since all of these except smoking have increased in prevalence in recent decades. this led to new concepts about occupational behavioral and environmental risk factors which are directly influenced by the socioeconomic conditions of the populations and have an important relationship with the causes of mortality. in this chapter we describe important conditions associated with increased cv risk that require concomitant assessment with classic cv risk factors when addressing cvd as a complex relationship between patients and the context in which they live. 10.2. socioeconomic factors and cardiovascular risk the health conditions of populations are influenced in a complex way by social determinants such as income 841 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 distribution wealth and education. these indicators act as interdependent risk factors for disease occurrence. relationships between mortality rates and socioeconomic level have already been evidenced in brazil and other countries showing an inverse relationship i.e. low socioeconomic levels are related to high mortality rates. these relationships between reductions in mortality rates in particular deaths from diseases of the circulatory system dcs and improvement in socioeconomic indicators are highly correlated. several prospective studies have shown that low socioeconomic status defined as low educational level low income low status employment or living in poorer residential areas have contributed to the increase in all causes of death as well as the risk of death from cvd.9 442 446 low socioeconomic status when defined as an independent cv risk factor has been shown to confer an increased risk for cvd with rr mortality between 1.3 and 2.0.445 447 the time periods in which there was a reduction in mortality rates due to diseases of the circulatory system were preceded by periods with improvement in socioeconomic indicators. in brazil between the 1930s and 1980s there was great economic growth that despite the concentration of income enabled educational sanitary economic and infrastructure improvements reducing infectious diseases and inflammatory processes. in developed countries the decline in cvd mortality began a little over a decade after the end of world war ii which followed the great depression of the early 1930s and the 1918 influenza pandemic. the same decline began just over 40 years after the beginning of the period of economic growth. exposure to infectious agents and other unhealthy conditions in the early years of life may make individuals more susceptible to the development of atherothrombogenesis. it is also possible that the reduction in exposure to infectious diseases in the early stages of life is related to the observed decline in adult cv mortality.442 446 448 452 strong correlations have been shown between the human development index falling child mortality rising per capita gross domestic product gdp and the increasing education levels with the reduction in mortality from diseases of the circulatory system in adults from 1980 in some brazilian states and municipalities showing that the improvement in socioeconomic indicators preceded the reduction of cv deaths. the great increase in education over the last decades which practically doubled in the states of rio de janeiro s o paulo and rio grande do sul had a great impact on mortality and is related to the reduction of more than 100 deaths from cvd with a one year increase in average years of study in adults. comprehensive measures to improve socioeconomic indicators should be part of the paradigm for cv disease control. these relationships show the importance of improving the living conditions of the population in order to reduce cv mortality.442 446 448 449 453 454 the assessment of social factors in patients and people with cv risk factors is essential as a means to stratify future preventive efforts with individual s risk profile. recommendations for socioeconomic indicators and cv risk are listed in table 10.1. 10.3. environmental factors and cardiovascular risk atherosclerosis has a complex and multifactorial pathophysiology depending on the integration of several factors inherent to the individual acquired or not with the environment in which he is inserted. the impact of environmental factors on the epidemiology of cv disease has been increasingly studied and recognized especially in relation to the possibility of adopting preventive strategies. in this context in addition to the influence of socioeconomic factors such as income and education the characteristics of the individual s own habitat and lifestyle are also considered. thus the natural and social environments are two different types that potentially influence cv disease.455 the natural environment is determined by specificites of the place where the individual resides such as altitude and latitude density of wooded areas seasons exposure to sunlight and atmospheric temperature. a study by massa et al. 456 in the city of s o paulo in 2010 suggested an inverse relationship between green area density and cv risk regardless of income.456 in addition cvd lethality appears to be higher in winter months while in some places there is an increase of up to 53 in the incidence of ami.457 this increase occurs similarly in young adults 55 years and in elderly 75 years individuals and may be a consequence of both hemodynamic variations. e.g. elevated bp as well as the higher incidence of respiratory infections at this time e.g. influenza which are known to increase the risk of heart attack.455 however elevated temperatures are also associated with a higher cvd risk especially when there is an abrupt variation in temperature.458 the social environment is related to the artificial forms of housing and the characteristic of daily life in modern society especially in the urban environment. population noise level violence access to clean water sanitation and air pollution may limit health promotion and promote the development of infectious and chronic diseases. in this context air pollution was established as the most important modifiable environmental determinant of cvd risk consisting of a complex mixture of gaseous particles and components.459 among such pollutants particulate matter pm is the element that is most relevant to health which is formed by substances whose size and types of particles vary over table 10.1 socioeconomic indicators and cardiovascular risk recommendation recommendation class level of evidence references socioeconomic indicators should be investigated in the clinical assessment and considered in the patient approach to improve the quality of life and prognosis of circulatory system diseases. iib b 483 484 486 488 842 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 time in the same region. the main sources of pm are motor vehicle emissions tire fragmentation and reuse in asphalt production energy industry related combustion ore processing agriculture construction and demolition activities forest burning and volcanic eruptions among others.460 thus because of the complexity related to their composition the particles are identified according to their diameter coarse pm or pm10 10 and 2.5 m fine pm or pm2.5 2.5 and 0.1 m ultrathin pm or pm0.1 0.1 m .459 current evidence suggests that pm2.5 is the major pollutant associated with increased cvd risk for both fatal and nonfatal events. the central justification for this relationship is the increased oxidative stress and systemic inflammation promoted by the particles. these effects result in the amplification of other traditional risk factors already present and in the potential instability of coronary plaques.461 according to the who the mean daily pm2.5 concentration should be 20 m m3 and the annual 10 m m3. with each 10 m m3 increase in short term exposure there is a 2.5 1 and 2.1 increase in the risks of admission or death from ami stroke and hf respectively. however as exposure tends to occur over several years atherosclerosis becomes progressive and cumulative and also affects regional cv mortality. thus recurrent events may occur even with average annual pm2.5 concentrations below the who targets. other consequences possibly associated with short and long term pollution are venous thromboembolism acute atrial fibrillation hypertension and insulin resistance.459 the recommendations for environmental indicators and cvd risk can be seen in table 10.2. 10.4. vaccination for people with heart disease in most clinical situations vaccination is identified as a primary prevention action. when it is transposed to heart disease it is usually secondary prevention for decompensations that aggravate pre existing cv disease. several vaccines are indicated for adults with priority to patients with ncd such as heart disease. we will list those prescribed for adults with heart disease. there is a specific guideline published by the brazilian society of cardiology regarding indications and doses of vaccines indicated for children and adolescents with heart disease. 10.4.1. prevention of respiratory tract infections in people with heart disease historical reports evidence the seasonal relationship of influenza epidemics with higher mortality among the elderly and patients with ncd. observational trials reports population studies and meta analyzes have proven the table 10.2 environmental indicators and cardiovascular risk recommendation recommendation class level of evidence references restrict

elderly and in patients with ncd with a marked reduction in overall mortality hospitalizations myocardial infarction and stroke rates.463 471 venous congestion and immunosuppression present in patients with ncd who are predisposed to infections are highlighted among the pathophysiological explanations. in contrast infections cause changes in coagulation factors platelet aggregation inflammatory response proteins tumor necrosis factor and cytokines and thus may be triggers for acute cv events. infections also play a chronic role in decreasing cardiomyocyte contraction strength inflammation thrombosis fibrin deposition and acceleration of the atherosclerosis process and cardiac remodeling.463 468 471 despite all the evidence and guidelines the rate of vaccination against respiratory infections influenza and pneumococcal pneumonia are low in brazil and worldwide.472 474 the overall consensus is for all patients with heart disease and ncds to be vaccinated regardless of age they are summarized in chart 10.1 and table 10.3. if the patient is over 60 the patient will be included in government campaigns according to age group. if the patient is under 60 years of age a referral form is required along with a declaration that there is a clinical indication for vaccination. 10.4.2. which vaccines influenza vaccine in brazil it is up to the ministry of health to determine the composition of the vaccine according to the prevalence of circulating types and strains in recent epidemics. it is an inactivated trivalent or tetravalent vaccine with the latter having a greater immunization spectrum. indications characteristics and restrictions are common to trivalent and tetravalent. vaccination should occur annually in the national campaign which takes place between april and may.475 477 pneumococcal vaccine there are two types of vaccine conjugate and polysaccharide. among the conjugates is pneumo 10 which is intended to prevent serious infections in children under 2 years of age therefore outside the scope of ncds with the exception of congenital heart disease. the other available type which is widely used is the pneumo 23 . this vaccine contains

young people. there is limited data available on the relationship between the risk of adverse effects and the presence of previous cvd disease interaction with cvd drugs and the use of the fractional

atheromatous plaque and its association with the various cvd risk factors is widely described in the literature. it is also recognized that the atherosclerotic phenomenon can occur in different vascular beds of larger or smaller caliber. the term peripheral arterial disease pad has been used to characterize atherosclerotic disease that affects several peripheral non coronary vascular beds. in this context the current pad guidelines deal with the theme in different ways. while the european directive 482 has chosen to analyze pad in various vascular territories i.e. carotid subclavian mesenteric renal and lower limb arteries the current american document 483 as well as the society for vascular directive surgery 484 deals exclusively with lower extremity pad. 844 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 more than 200 million people worldwide are estimated to have diverse stages of pad ranging from the asymptomatic phase of the disease to intermittent claudication ic and the more severe late stages of the disease.485 prevalence increases with aging rising by more than 10 in patients aged 60 to 70 years and over 20 in patients over 80 years of age. although the prevalence of symptomatic and more severe forms of pad is higher in men a recent study of 3.6 million individuals in the us has shown that women may be worsening the odds of developing the disease compared to men odds ratio or of 1.62 95 confidence interval between 1.60 1.64 . inversely women were less prone to carotid stenosis or abdominal aortic aneurysm aaa than men.485 486 publications of previous decades already evidenced that the simultaneous presence of pad and cvd or cerebrovascular is frequent especially at older ages. likewise the anatomopathological characteristics and clinical manifestations of cvd in patients with pad are usually more severe with a higher occurrence of multivessel coronary branch injury and a higher prevalence of left coronary trunk injury.487 488 10.5.2. interrelationship between the various cardiovascular risk factors and lower extremity peripheral artery disease in most studies the proportion of symptomatic patients ranges from 20 to 33 among all patients with pad. in the swedish population aged 60 90 years the prevalence of lower extremity pad was 18 and intermittent claudication 7 .489 in brazil a multicenter cross sectional study evaluated 1 170 individuals in 72 urban centers. the prevalence of intermittent claudication was 9 among those with abi below the cutoff point of 0.9. in this analysis women with coronary artery disease were 4.9 times more at risk for lower extremity pad.490 arterial hypertension hypertension increases the chance of lower extremity pad by 32 up to 2.2 times in various epidemiological studies. although the risk of hypertension causing lower extremity pad has been modest in some studies the high prevalence of this risk factor among the elderly reinforces the epidemiological burden of lower limb arteriopathy.489 a comprehensive study of more than 4.2 million individuals in primary health care in the uk investigated the association between hypertension and the risk of lower extremity pad. in this study with each 20 mmhg increase in systolic blood pressure in hypertensive men aged 40 79 years the risk of lower extremity pad increased by 63 . lower extremity pad was associated with an increased risk of ischemic heart disease ckd hf aortic aneurysm and atrial fibrillation however it was not associated with hemorrhagic stroke.491 the harmonica project a finnish community based report showed that the prevalence of asymptomatic without claudication lower extremity pad by means of abi was 7.3 in 532 hypertensive subjects compared with 2.3 in 440 normotensive individuals. by adjusting multiple variables hypertension continued to be an independent risk factor associated with lower extremity pad more than tripling the occurrence of lower limb arterial involvement or 3.20 . hypertensive patients with borderline and altered abi represented one third of all participants with hypertension in the average age range of 60 7 years.492 smoking this is a particularly prominent risk factor in atherosclerotic disease of the lower extremities. the prospective health professionals follow up study hpfs investigated 44 985 men with lower extremity pad aged 40 to 75 years with a history of limb amputation need for revascularization arterial angiographic injury 50 occlusion and abi below 0 90. the authors followed the attributable risk of four of the most traditional risk factors diabetes hypertension hypercholesterolemia and smoking by a median follow up of 24.2 years. active smoking significantly increased the adjusted risk of lower extremity pad by 12.89 fold 95 confidence interval between 8.59 and 19.34 compared with individuals who had never smoked. also in participants who stopped smoking for more than 20 years the risk of lower extremity pad remained 39 higher than in those who had never smoked.493 the guangzhou biobank cohort study gbcs evaluated the association between second hand smoke exposure and lower extremity pad in non smokers. by adjusting for confounding variables exposure to residential passive smoke for 25 hours week or more was significantly associated lower extremity pad or 7.86 p 0.003 .494 diabetes the presence of diabetes increases the risk of lower extremity pad by 1.9 to 4 times compared to non diabetics.489 in our country the risk of diabetic men developing lower extremity pad was 6.6 times higher than that of non diabetics.490 a case control trial in patients with diabetic foot investigated ulcers that progressed to amputation. after adjusting several variables at least three widely known risk factors were predictors of amputation risk i. hba1c level 8 p 0.002 ii. hypertriglyceridemia p 0.004 and

pad in the fh group went from 17.3 to 2.3 in the group with appropriate lipid profile p 0.001 .496 classic risk factors continue to play a relevant role when lower extremity pad progresses to more severe forms of vascular impairment such as critical lower limb ischemia cli or acute limb ischemia. such presentations of lower extremity pad have a poor prognosis in terms of disability and death. the uk based prospective population based oxford vascular study oxvasc analyzed the incidence of severe peripheral ischemic outcomes in 92 728 patients. compared with the control population the

preventive approach to lower extremity pad risk factors are equally applicable both regarding the asymptomatic and symptomatic intermittent claudication form of the disease.484 the items listed below and in particular chart 10.3 summarize the risk factors and proposed treatment approaches including recommendation class level of evidence according to the latest international guidelines for lower extremity pad i. smoking cessation is recommended for people with lower extremity pad.482 484 ii. physical exercise in patients with claudication due to lower extremity pad a supervised exercise program is recommended to improve functional performance and quality of life.482 484 the comprehensive review by olin et al. 501 highlights that the methodology of supervised exercise either home or community based has improved considerably over the past decade. iii. antiplatelet despite the small sample size n 366 the clips study showed the benefit of asa in preventing 52 of vascular events such

vascular amputation was 22.9 the risk of death was 8.7 and major cv events reached 3.8 . in this study rivaroxaban direct selective coagulation factor xa inhibitor at a dose of 2.5 mg twice daily

but it has been relevant as a hypothesis and has reinforced the importance of further investigation on the possible role of new oral anticoagulants in the prevention of vascular events in symptomatic lower extremity pad. vi. antihypertensives in hypertensive patients with lower extremity pad strict bp control below 140 90 mmhg with first choice drugs is recommended. vii. renin angiotensin inhibitor drugs such as ace inhibitors or arbs when tolerated are recommended to control bp in lower extremity pad.482 483 viii. hypolipidemics management of hypercholesterolaemia in patients with lower extremity pad aims to keep ldl cholesterol below 70 mg dl or reduce it by 50 if baseline levels are between 70 135 mg dl.482 statin prescription is broadly recommended in current international guidelines.482 484 statins reduce the risk of cvd and lower limb ischemic events in patients with lower extremity pad.482 483 ix. the fourier study tested evolocumab pcsk 9 inhibitor monoclonal antibody in patients aged 40 to 85 years with a history of clinically evident atherosclerotic cvd disease. in this trial 13.5 of patients in the evolocumab group and 12.9 in the placebo group had

severity such as critical lower limb ischemia.482 483 484 the objective is to reduce ischemic events in the lower extremities.483 in addition to their efficacy in glycemic control new hypoglycemic drugs have been required to demonstrate cv safety. in the empa reg study the sglt 2 inhibitor empagliflozin reduced the risk of cv death by 38 . a recent subanalysis of this study showed that in patients with lower extremity pad at the start of the trial the risk of lower limb amputation in the empagliflozin group was not significantly different from placebo hr 0.84 95 confidence interval

group versus 1.3 in placebo p 0.53 .507 while further analysis is awaited it is important that patients using sglt 2 inhibitors maintain routine preventive foot care and adequate hydration. monitoring the patient with lower extremity pad at risk of foot infections ulcer gangrene or osteomyelitis is critical. r i sk fac to r s therapeut i c conduct and the i r recommendation classes lower extremity pad evidence levels according to the latest international peripheral artery disease guidelines are listed in chart 10.3. 10.6. autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular risk several autoimmune diseases can affect the heart through various manifestations including arrhythmias pericardial myocardial and coronary artery diseases. in relation to this last complication advances and research in the field of atherosclerosis have increasingly reinforced the participation of the immune system in its pathophysiology. the presence of lymphocytes and macrophages within atheromatous plaques suggests that inflammation is a major factor in the disease evolution cascade. this hypothesis even motivated a recent clinical trial that evaluated the effect of low dose methotrexate on the reduction of cv events in patients without autoimmune diseases but with previous infarction. although the reduction in the primary outcome was not achieved in this study further work in this area is still ongoing. however in patients with rheumatic diseases the systemic inflammatory process is amplified and which may result in the occurrence of accelerated atherosclerosis.509 this condition may be the main explanation for the high percentages of morbidity and mortality in these patients.510 in addition the use of certain immunosuppressive medications such as corticosteroids may also contribute to the worsening of the cv risk profile. it is worth mentioning ra and systemic lupus erythematosus sle among the diseases that may have this pathophysiological feature although other conditions such as scleroderma inflammatory bowel diseases psoriasis and certain primary vasculitis such as polyangeitis granulomatosis are also relevant.509 511 ra is associated with a 3 fold reduction in survival with ischemic heart disease accounting for about 40 of deaths.512 in addition the risk of ami is about 2 times higher than in the general population and the prognosis after the event tends to be worse. this scenario begins to develop at the onset of the disease and independently of other factors classically associated with atherosclerosis. vascular inflammation caused by autoimmunity seems to play a more important role in this context. some population studies even suggest a recent reduction in cv lethality in these patients perhaps due to the greater availability of disease specific treatments.513 nevertheless functional limitation and consequent physical inactivity imposed by ra may also increase the likelihood of developing other risk factors such as obesity hypertension and diabetes. on the other hand it is noteworthy that systemic inflammation in individuals with ra can reduce serum levels of total cholesterol and ldl promoting what is known as the lipid paradox since the risk of events remains high even with this metabolic profile.513 514 nevertheless control of traditional risk factors remains the main strategy for preventing cv events in these patients. like ra sle also behaves as an independent risk factor for cv disease with a coronary disease prevalence of up to 10 and a risk of events up to 8 times higher than the general population. some studies suggest that ami may be the cause of death in up to 25 of cases especially in patients who have the disease for longer.509 at the same time the prevalence of major cv risk factors such as hypertension diabetes obesity physical inactivity and dyslipidemia is also higher in individuals with sle. frequent use of corticosteroids for disease management is another condition that worsens the metabolic profile although daily doses of prednisone below 10 mg appear to be safe in this respect as do antimalarial drugs.515 nevertheless risk calculators using traditional factors often underestimate the incidence of events in these patients. other markers associated with atherosclerosis that are more relevant in individuals with sle such as osteoprotegerin and osteopontin are promising predictors that could refine this estimate. the fact that disease associated coronary artery disease is more often associated with atherosclerosis than vasculitis corroborates this expectation.516 as most autoimmune diseases are more common among women a thorough stratification of cv risk in females is essential in the presence of these conditions despite the limitations already mentioned. even so the fundamental issue is the absence of clinical studies demonstrating a benefit in treating this group of patients more aggressively. to date there is no evidence that therapeutic targets for blood pressure blood glucose ldl cholesterol or any other risk factor should be modified due to the presence of an autoimmune disease. the relatively low prevalence of these diseases in the population is the main factor limiting good quality studies to answer these questions. therefore each case needs to 847 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891

disease the overall prevalence of ckd is estimated at 11 13 517 and in brazil despite inconsistent data it is estimated that between three and six million people have the disease.518 the relationship between ckd and cvd is complex dynamic and multifactorial. in addition to both sharing risk factors such as systemic arterial hypertension diabetes and advanced age there is a higher prevalence of traditional cvd risk factors in patients with ckd.519 520 in a study by foley et al. 519 with more than 15 000 patients 83.6 of those with estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 and 100 of those with gfr e 30 ml min 1.73 m2 had at least two risk factors for cvd.519 furthermore the loss of renal function itself causes changes that can accelerate cvd such as arterial stiffness and anemia contributing to left ventricular hypertrophy endothelial dysfunction disease chronic inflammation vitamin d deficiency oxidative stress and activation of the renin angiotensin system.520 523 the result of this interaction is that cvd is the leading cause of death in patients with ckd.521 in a meta analysis by van der velde et al. 524 evaluating cohorts of patients with hypertension diabetes or cv disease they observed an increase in all causes of mortality with egfr reduction and rates of 60 45 and 15 ml min 1.73m2 presented a hazard ratio of 1.03 1.38 and table 10.4 autoimmune diseases and cardiovascular risk recommendation recommendation class level of evidence references in the context of preventing cardiovascular events the benefit of using stricter therapeutic targets specifically due to the presence of autoimmune diseases is uncertain iib c 513 514 516 3.11 respectively when compared to patients with egfr 95 ml min 1.73 m2. in addition the presence of albuminuria even when borderline was also associated with higher mortality in this same study and urinary albumin creatinine ratios of 10 mg g 30 mg g and 300 mg g presented a hazard ratio of 1.08 1.38 and 2.16 when compared to the ratio of 5 mg g.524 currently ckd525 and albuminuria are considered independent predictors of cv522 526 events and thus cv prevention plays a key role in the management of ckd patients. overall the risk assessment should be individualized and ckd should be interpreted in the context of the overall risk assessment according to each clinical setting and is considered a high risk cv marker.7 525 given the various clinical scenarios related to ckd it is worth mentioning systemic arterial hypertension dyslipidemia and the use of antiplatelet agents in primary prevention. with regard to systemic arterial hypertension risk stratification and treatment to prevent events and additional loss of renal function should follow the guidelines published by this society.146 it is noteworthy that in this case ckd is used in the additional risk stratification according to egfr and urinary albumin creatinine ratio and can be interpreted as target organ damage egfr 30 60 ml min 1.73 m2 or urinary albumin creatinine 30 300 mg g or as an established disease egfr 30 ml min 1.73 m2 or urinary albumin creatinine 300 mg g . similarly the approach to dyslipidemia in ckd patients should follow the stratification and treatment model proposed in this society s specific guideline.7 in this case ckd egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 is considered as a high risk cv marker for proposed goals and treatments.7 849 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 finally regarding the use of antiplatelet agents in primary prevention the evidence regarding its benefit is not robust enough to indicate its routine use considering ckd alone. in a meta analysis of more than 50 studies and more than 27 000 patients the use of asa reduced the risk of infarction without however reducing overall mortality cv mortality or stroke with increased numbers of major and minor bleeds.527 thus the use of antiplatelet agents should be assessed according to the overall risk and decision making should be made on an individual basis when considering their use solely for ckd. recommendations for ckd and cv risk can be seen in table 10.5. 10.8. obstructive sleep apnea in recent years much has been debated about obstructive sleep apnea osa as a cv risk factor and in 2018 the brazilian society of cardiology published a position on this clinical condition and its implications on cv risk.528 osa is characterized by the temporary narrowing or occlusion of the upper airway during sleep 529 which in turn activates the sympathetic nervous system and triggers a chain of events involving elevation of blood pressure release of inflammatory mediators oxidative stress endothelial dysfunction reduced insulin sensitivity and activation of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system.528 530 despite the short duration of events prolonged repetitive exposure to periods of hypoventilation and hypoxemia can lead to chronic changes in metabolism and circulatory system leading to consequences such as systemic arterial hypertension pulmonary hypertension arrhythmias coronary disease stroke heart failure diabetes dyslipidemia and increased mortality cv.528 533 the prevalence of osa has increased in recent years528 529 and some series have reported apnea hypopnea index equal to or greater than 5 events per hour in 34 of men and 17 of women aged 30 to 70.534 in cvd patients the prevalence of osa is higher when compared to patients of the same age and sex in the general population regardless of body mass index.529 among cvd hypertension coronary artery disease stroke and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with reports of associated prevalence of osa of up to 83 58 91 and 53 respectively.528 529 the treatment of osa is mainly based on the use of continuous positive airway pressure cpap . there is evidence that this treatment modality has beneficial effects on blood pressure control 535 but evidence regarding rigid outcomes such as total and cv mortality is not as robust 528 530 with data on primary prevention from observational studies.531 536 in a recent systematic and meta analysis review no reduction in major cv events including vascular death or all cause death was observed.537 it is worth mentioning that in 60 of the studies evaluated cv disease secondary prevention was documented and in such cases with patients undergoing optimal clinical treatment cpap treatment may have little additional effect than current treatment when assessing total mortality and cv outcomes 530 537 despite the benefits of blood pressure control and improvement of extra cardiac symptoms.530 finally cv prevention strategies in osa patients should consider the higher morbidity and mortality attributed to this condition emphasizing the control of other associated risk factors and respecting specific treatment indications according to this society s position

maintain an erection that allows for satisfactory sexual activity. ed is not a disease but a symptomatic manifestation of isolated or associated pathologies.538 it has a prevalence of just over 50 in men over 40 years of age in the usa and brazil. studies have shown a prevalence between 43 and 46 in the same age range.538 541 the causes of ed can be classified as psychological organic or a combination of both. organic factors include vascular endocrine neurological drug related causes and urological interventions. vascular etiology is the most common cause of erectile dysfunction.

that contribute to the occurrence of ed.542 544 ed is currently recognized as being of vascular etiology in most men with endothelial dysfunction as the common denominator. ed often precedes cvd and is often present in men with known cvd leading to the concept that a man with ed and no cvd symptoms is a patient with cvd until proven otherwise and a man with known cvd should be routinely asked about your erectile dysfunction. ed also has a significant negative impact on the patient and partner one man s problem but a couple s concern thus emphasizing the need to approach ed as early as possible.545 a meta analysis of 20 prospective cohort studies involving 36 744 participants suggested that erectile dysfunction significantly increases the risk of ischemic heart disease stroke and all cause mortality and concluded that it could play a role in quantifying cv risk based on traditional risk factors.546 another population based study of 95 038 men aged 45 and over showed that cvd risk is related to the severity of erectile dysfunction in men with and without established cvd with a relative risk respectively of 1.6 and 1.7 for the development of ischemic heart disease.547 all men with erectile dysfunction should be considered potential candidates for primary prevention cv risk stratification and treated according to their risk estimates. recommendations for autoimmune diseases and cv risk are listed in table 10.7. 10.10. prevention of rheumatic heart disease rheumatic heart disease rhd is the cardiac consequence of acute rheumatic fever arf an inflammatory disease caused by streptococcal pharyngitis. its prevalence is closely related to unfavorable sanitary conditions agglomerations and inadequate access to health systems.548 over the last decades there has been a significant reduction in prevalence and mortality from rhd worldwide with a reduction in standardized global mortality of 47 8 from 1990 to 20152 markedly in developed countries and even near eradication in some regions. however the burden of disease remains high in underdeveloped countries and even in poor regions of developed countries.548 in 2015 the highest age standardized mortality rates for rhd prevalence were observed in oceania south asia and central sub saharan africa but there is clearly an underestimation of data from brazil and latin america partly due to the scarcity of primary data. it is estimated that in 2015 there were 33.4 million cases and approximately 10.5 million disability adjusted life years daly attributable to rhd worldwide.549 the principal determinant of rf is the admittedly repeated infection with group a beta hemolytic streptococci gas and some theories attempt to explain the pathophysiology involved in susceptibility to damage which affects only 6 of individuals exposed to gas a an antigenic similarity between agent structures m protein surface and glcnac epitope and molecules in host tissues triggering an exaggerated immune response and b generation of a neo antigen through contact between gas and collagen matrix subendothelial with consequent binding between m proteins and cb3 region of collagen type iv inducing an autoimmune response against collagen.548 thus primary prevention of rf requires early identification and appropriate therapy for gas pharyngitis. when selecting a treatment regimen consideration should be given to the bacteriological and clinical efficacy ease of adherence to the recommended regimen ie dosing frequency duration of therapy and acceptability cost spectrum of activity of the selected agent and potential adverse effects. in this context intramuscular benzathine penicillin g oral potassium penicillin v and oral amoxicillin are the recommended antimicrobial agents for the treatment of gas pharyngitis in people without penicillin allergy table 10.8 . gas resistance to penicillin has never been documented and penicillin potentially prevents primary attacks of rf even when started nine days after the onset of infection.550 551 in recent decades the long asymptomatic period of rhd and the possibility of early interventions in the subclinical phase have led to the increased role of echocardiography in disease management with the development of population screening studies and the publication of the 2015 revised jones criteria.552 in addition to the incorporation of detected subclinical carditis on echocardiography patients were stratified according to population risk for rhd 552 554 with different criteria for endemic and non endemic regions chart 10.4 . once rhd is diagnosed prevention strategies should focus on preventing recurrences that are associated with worsening or developing rhd. a gas infection does not necessarily have to be symptomatic to trigger a recurrence and rhd can recur even when a symptomatic infection is correctly treated. therefore prevention requires continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis rather than simply recognizing and treating acute episodes of pharyngitis.548 therefore continuous prophylaxis is recommended in patients with well documented history of rhd and in those with evidence of rhd. prophylaxis should be started as soon as rhd or rf is diagnosed. in order to eradicate gas in the oropharynx a complete penicillin cycle should be given to patients with rhd even for those with a negative oropharyngeal culture.548

rheumatic carditis with or without valvular disease are at high risk for recurrence and presumably a progressive risk of more severe cardiac involvement at each episode.555 these patients should receive long term antibiotic prophylaxis until adulthood and in selected cases for life. patients with persistent valvular disease should receive prophylaxis for 10 years after the last episode of rhd or until the age of 40 whichever one is longer. the severity of valvular disease and the potential for day to day gas exposure should be determined and lifetime prophylaxis should be considered in those at high risk e.g permanent contact with children in schools and day care centers care for institutionalized patients work in health facilities etc. .550 551 in non endemic regions administration of benzathine penicillin g every 4 weeks is the recommended regimen for secondary prophylaxis in most situations. in higher risk populations administration every 3 weeks is warranted because serum antimicrobial levels may fall below protection levels before 4 weeks after the initial dose table 10.9 . regarding echocardiographic screening studies in high risk populations have shown that its accuracy is arguably higher than auscultation for detection of subclinical rf 554 and its application at the research level has grown exponentially in the last decade. based on screening programs involving more than 100 000 patients in 2012 the world heart federation whf published the first evidence based consensus standardizing the criteria for echocardiographic diagnosis of rf borderline and definitive .555 the concepts of subclinical echocardiographic findings without alterations on clinical examination and latent a broader spectrum encompassing rhd present on echocardiography with no known prior history of rf or rhd were defined.555 the population echocardiographic screening strategy has already been tested in brazil and its implementation has proved feasible in schools especially the public schools in regions with low socioeconomic indices and primary health care with diagnostic support by telemedicine.556 557 in addition non physician imaging using the whf simplified protocol was effective including the basic identification of changes related to rhd.558 there was a high prevalence of subclinical rhd in low income regions of 4.5 4.0 borderline and 0.5 definitive .556 557 however despite the various cohorts involving these patients the clinical significance and prognostic implication of these findings has not been well established so far. recently a score derived from large population studies in brazil and uganda has been proposed to stratify patients according to the risk of rhd progression based on weights attributed to the echocardiographic variables in the whf criteria.559 however it has also been shown that giving a child a diagnosis of latent rhd can potentially worsen their quality of life and create stigmas 560 which raises important questions about the risk benefit ratio of large screening programs. for these reasons there is no indication for the use of echocardiographic screening outside the research field until further studies on its impact on disease progression are completed. 11. child and adolescence 11.1. introduction childhood and adolescence are the phases with the most potential for the prevention of atherosclerosis. there is robust evidence based on analyzes of the aortas and coronary arteries that atherosclerosis begins at fetal age. however more recent studies show that atherosclerosis may regress in children more easily than in adults since their lesions are less complex and fixed. cvd risk factors respect the tracking phenomenon i.e. a child who has some risk factor will probably have the same factor in adulthood with similar intensity. coupled with the fact that health habits are formed in childhood and adolescence there is a clear need and possibility to prevent atherosclerosis from an early age.561 therefore we will present strategies to control the main habits and risk factors that can be controlled in this age group. recommendation level iia level of evidence b . 11.2. childhood and adolescent nutrition nutrition is the basis of health promotion in childhood and adolescence. in addition eating habits are mainly formed by 7 years of age reinforcing the importance of food education from an early age. population studies show that almost all children ingest larger amounts of poor quality fat and added sugar or lower amounts of fiber than recommended for their age. the following principles are recommended for good child growth and development to prevent atherosclerosis from childhood 562 564 recommendation level iia level of evidence c . 1. exclusive breast milk up to 6 months and introducing other foods up to 2 years old. 2. eating fresh and whole foods from 6 months of age starting with pureed foods and then eating the family diet which should be as healthy as possible. 853 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 3. age appropriate caloric intake taking into account their basal metabolic rate as well as growth and exercise needs except in children with special conditions or inadequate growth and body composition. 4. offer the child the most varied and colorful food possible respecting the proportionality between protein 10 to 20 of total daily caloric volume fat 30 to 40 and carbohydrates 30 to 50 in each age provided there are not any risk factors that require different proportions. 5. encourage the daily intake of fruits and vegetables by offering this type of food at every meal. the child should eat the equivalent of his age 5 in grams of fiber. 6. avoid sugar ideally less than 5 of total daily calories coffee canned goods fried foods soft drinks candies snacks and other treats throughout development these foods should be banned in infants. replace whenever possible processed and ultra processed foods with fresh or minimally processed foods regardless of age and body composition. 7. use salt sparingly. children s food must have a less spice and salt than an adult s 1.2 to 1.5 g day of salt for children up to preschool age and up to 2 g day in school children and adolescents. 8. associate proteins of animal and vegetal origin eat whole grains and vegetables at least 5 times a week in the ratio of 3 1. animal proteins should be of varied origins encouraging the consumption of fish. 9. frequent water intake throughout the day limiting the intake of juices even if natural and without added sugar ideally only provide juices from 1 year of age and at most 120 ml 180 ml and 240 ml for infants preschoolers and schoolchildren respectively. 10. offer high nutritional value fats such as nuts nuts almonds walnuts among others and vegetable oils as long as they are safe avoid fresh nuts in children under 3 years due to the risk of aspiration and according to age appropriate amount. avoid the intake of trans fats as much as possible. for children with dyslipidemia fat intake should be limited to about 25 30 of their total daily calories while maintaining a proportion of 7 to 10 saturated fat and 20 mono and polyunsaturated fat similar to recommendations for adults. the addition of sugar should be avoided and the intake of omega 3 in the form of fish rich in these fatty acids ideally 2 or 3 times a week should be encouraged. follow up with a nutritionist or nutrologist is recommended when there is a risk of malnutrition or impaired growth and development.565 recommendation level iia evidence level a . for children with sah the dash diet should be used as in adults which includes increasing the proportion of fresh foods especially fruits and vegetables and reducing salt intake.566 recommendation level iia level of evidence b . control of the food environment is of utmost importance in childhood and adolescence especially the school environment which should be protected by public policies that encourage the supply of foods with high nutritional value and restrict ultra processed high calorie or high density foods with added sugar and trans fats.567 recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.3. physical activity in childhood and adolescence physical activity is considered an independent protective factor in the primary prevention of coronary artery disease since childhood because of its effect on modulating traditional risk factors and promoting normal endothelial function. higher levels of physical activity are associated with improved bone health nutritional status cardiometabolic health cognitive function and reduced risk of depression.568 intervention programs to increase physical activity in children are associated with improved blood pressure and lipid profile.569 physical activity is considered any body movement that results in energy expenditure. physical exercise consists of planned structured and repetitive physical activity. in brazil the prevalence of physical inactivity was assessed in a sample of 74 589 adolescents in the study of cardiovascular risks in adolescents erica . the prevalence of leisure time physical inactivity reached 54.3 being especially worrying in female adolescents 70.7 . more than a quarter of adolescents reported no leisure time physical activity.570 the discussion about childhood physical activity has two important aspects for cardiovascular prevention. the first is the tracking phenomenon described above highlighting the importance of establishing healthy habits at a time when the child is developing which is much easier to intervene than after the sedentary lifestyle has been established and excessive screen time more than 2 hours day . the second aspect is the accumulation of risk or protective factors over the course of life which can determine different levels of risk over many years of exposure. regarding these concepts in 2016 the american heart association published the cardiovascular health promotion in children document challenges and opportunities for 2020 and beyond the scientific statement from the american heart association stating that maintaining optimal cv health from birth to young adulthood is critical part of reducing cvd disease in adulthood.571 the physical activity level considered ideal for children and adolescents aged 6 to 17 years is 60 minutes or more per day of intense to vigorous aerobic activity. the document also recommends performing muscle strength activity and muscle strengthening and bone loading1 at least three times a week recommendation level iia evidence level b .568 571 preschoolers 3 5 years old should remain active throughout the day to encourage growth development and to acquire a repertoire of motor skills. caregivers should aim to achieve a total of at least 3 active hours per day diversifying from mild to vigorous intensities recommendation level iia level of evidence b . although there is no consensus on the amount of activity or exercise needed to treat cv risk factors such as dyslipidemia hypertension or obesity in childhood it is known that even without effective control of their cv risk physical activity is one of the most important pillars in the prevention of 854 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 atherosclerosis with improvement of endothelial function and even regression of intimal thickening markers of subclinical atherosclerosis.571 572 recommendation level iia level of evidence b . current evidence for adults shows that total activity volume is more important than the duration of each individual session.573 recommendations for all age groups emphasize increasing overall physical activity moving more and reducing sedentary activity avoiding long sitting periods whenever possible. for children this means encouraging outdoor play whenever possible activities with different levels of intensity such as walking the dog storing toys walking to school among others. it also means from a public policy point of view ensuring safe spaces for children and adolescents to play sports or jogging an urban layout that encourages walking or cycling and the structure and availability of qualified physical exercise teachers schools and other community locations such as parks and gyms.568 573 recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.4. smoking in children and adolescence about 18.5 of brazilian adolescents have tried cigarette smoking. smoking increases cv risk in childhood even when it is passive low birth weight higher risk of childhood obesity it also determines endothelial dysfunction as early as childhood in addition to all pulmonary neurological risks.574 575 childhood is the most important phase for smoking prevention as about 90 of people start smoking by age 18. in addition it is an ideal moment for parental smoking cessation as they may change their habits if the harmful effects of secondhand smoke are shown to their children. this intervention should occur in different environments 2 of which may be directly addressed by the physician 576 recommendation level i level of evidence c . at the pediatrician clinic 1. ask about your child s passive exposure to smoking during childcare consultations and in consultations regarding potentially smoking related illnesses. ask about caregiver and environment smoking electronic cigarettes and cannabis use. 2. include smoking prevention in your childcare agenda. clarification about the harms of smoking in consultations from 5 years of age. for teens talk about the effects on appearance sports performance and costs. discuss electronic cigarette. 3. recommend treatment for caregivers who smoke. refer to specialized smoking cessation services. 4. offer treatment to adolescent smokers users who want to quit smoking. moderate or severe adolescent users may benefit from drug treatment. periodic follow up should occur due to the high chance of relapse. 5. closely assess the risk of psychiatric symptoms during treatment. suicidal ideation and suicide may occur which must be monitored and treated. 6. do not recommend the use of electronic cigarettes. the harmful effects are similar. 7. if second hand smoke cannot be eliminated agree on measures that minimize exposure. in medical schools at all levels of teaching and learning and for all health professionals smoking cessation training should be provided. the prevention of active and passive smoking as well as forms of intervention in smoking cessation should be part of the curriculum of pediatric and family medicine residency programs due to the great importance of abuse in the general population. recommendation level i level of evidence c . 11.5. obesity in childhood and adolescence between 1975 and 2016 the prevalence of obesity between 5 and 19 years increased on average from 0.7 to 5.6 in girls and from 0.8 to 7.8 in boys in all geographic regions of the world. the study estimated that in 2016 there were 50 million obese girls and 74 million obese boys worldwide.577 in brazil the 2015 national school health survey identified a prevalence of overweight and obesity in 23.3 and 8.5 in students from 13 to 17 years old respectively.578 11.5.1.

hypertension in childhood and adolescence bp screening data in childhood and adolescence show a prevalence of sah of up to 8.2 582 583 which decreases to approximately 3.5 when measurements are repeated at clinical follow up. prehypertension is observed in approximately 2.2 to 3.5 of the population in overweight and obese adolescents it can reach 24.8 . it is also associated with sleep disorders 3.6 to 14 chronic kidney disease up to 50 diabetes mellitus 9.5 aorta narrowing 17 to 77 endocrine alterations 0.05 to 6 and prematurity 7.3 .584 although hypertension in children is more often due to a secondary cause with a defined etiology there has been an increase in the diagnoses of primary hypertension especially in older children and adolescents when other risk factors are associated such as overweight and obesity. blood pressure measurement is considered mandatory from the age of three on an annual basis or before this age when the child has a neonatal history history of prematurity history of aortic narrowing kidney disease diabetes mellitus or is using medication that can increase blood pressure. sah is defined by the blood pressure percentile in relation to age sex and height. the tables with gender age and height percentiles https pediatrics. aappublications.org content pediatrics 140 3 e2017 have been redefined in the american clinical practice guideline for screening and management of high blood pressure in children and adolescents facilitating the adoption of a single table containing the three parameters used and the assigned percentile. as we do not have specific tables for the brazilian population this criterion is used for our population. the first blood pressure measurement can be performed by the oscillometric method on the right arm using an appropriate cuff. if the result of this measurement is greater than or equal to the 90th percentile another measurement must be taken if the mean of these two measurements is still 90th percentile two measurements by auscultatory method should be performed. table 11.1 shows blood pressure levels in normal and hypertensive children and adolescents. recommendation level i level of

the progression of atherosclerosis. considering all lipid fractions the prevalence of dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence has remained between 30 40 .587 according to the erica study which evaluated 38 000 adolescents in brazil the prevalence of dyslipidemia in this group was as follows 46 had hdl cholesterol concentrations below 45 mg dl 20.1 had total cholesterol concentrations greater than 170 mg dl 7.8 had triglyceride concentrations greater than 130 mg dl and 3.5 ldl cholesterol concentrations greater than 130 mg dl.588 11.7.1. causes the causes of primary or secondary dyslipidemia are similar in adults and children. it is worth mentioning some specificities in childhood such as the higher prevalence of more severe primary types that do not allow survival until adulthood if not treated intensively and early such as familial hypercholesterolaemia heterozygous or homozygous and lipoprotein lipase deficiency monogenic hypertriglyceridemia . among the secondary causes ketogenic diet used in refractory epilepsy has been identified more frequently in addition to obesity physical inactivity and inadequate diet considered at epidemic levels in the country.589 11.7.2. normal values the lipid profile should be measured between 9 and 11 years of age. at the population level fasting free dosing can be of great value due to its practicality and cost especially in these cases measuring hdl and non hdl levels. in younger children it should be done in children 2 years and older when there is an early family history of atherosclerosis any cv risk factor or habits table 11.2 or clinical signs compatible with monogenic severe primary dyslipidemia. normal values are described in table 11.3.590 591 11.7.3. treatment the treatment is initially based on intensive lifestyle modification for at least 6 months with weight control diet and physical activity as already described.7 the goal of ldl cholesterol for drug use varies according to the risk

diseases 12.1. introduction the population is aging in brazil and in the world. the brazilian population has maintained an aging trend in recent years and has gained 4.8 million elderly people since 2012 surpassing the 30.2 million mark in 2017 according to the national household sample survey pnad.594 in 2012 there were 25.4 million people aged 60 and over. the 4.8 million new elderly in five years correspond to an 18 growth in this age group which has become increasingly representative in brazil. women are the majority in this group with 16.9 million 56 of the elderly while elderly men are 13.3 million 44 of the group .594 between 2012 and 2017 the number of elderly grew in all units of the federation with rio de janeiro and rio grande do sul being the states with the highest proportion of elderly both with 18.6 of their populations within this age group. amap in turn is the state with the lowest percentage of the elderly with only 7.2 of the population figure 12.1 .594 according to the who the world s population of elderly people is increasing and in the coming decades the world s population of people over 60 years of age will grow from the current 841 million to 2 billion by 2050 making chronic diseases and well being new global public health challenges.595 by 2020 we will have for the first time in history more people over 60 than children under five reported the who in a health and aging series in the lancet medical journal noting that 80 of older people will live in low and middle income countries.595 the who also states that the increase in longevity especially in high income countries is mainly due to the decline in cvd deaths such as stroke and ischemic heart disease through simple and cost effective interventions to reduce smoking and high bp.595 old people or very old people aged 85 and over will increase by 351 between 2010 and 2050 compared with an increase of 188 for the population aged 65 and over and an increase of 22 for the 65 year old population figure 12.2 .596 over the next 10 to 15 years people in every region of the world will suffer more deaths and disabilities from noncommunicable diseases such as heart disease cancer and diabetes.596 these data are directly linked to inadequate lifestyles of the population such as physical inactivity obesity and stress leading to an increased prevalence of risk factors such as hypertension smoking diabetes and dyslipidemia with consequent increase in mortality and cv morbidity. ah is the leading risk factor for death and cvd worldwide597 598 figure 12.3.597 599 the

society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 based on the above data strategies to address these risk factors as well as disease prevention and health promotion actions for at risk populations should be implemented as soon as possible and start as early as possible. some considerations related to the population aspects of risk factors will be discussed specifically in this chapter and others. 12.2. population aspect of smoking cigarette smoking is one of the leading and preventable causes of mortality in the world. this habit accounts for 12 of adult mortality worldwide which corresponds to 5 million people if this persists 10 million people per year will die and 70 of these deaths will occur in developing countries. specifically in brazil the national congress approved the text of the global framework convention on tobacco use fctc through legislative decree 1012 of october 28 2005 and the brazilian government ratified the 2005 convention which entered into force on february 1 2006. the primary goal of the fctc is to preserve present and future generations from the devastating health social environmental and economic consequences of smoking and exposure to tobacco smoke. it establishes some of its obligations to draft and update smoking control policy establish an international coordination and cooperation mechanism with other states parties and protect national policies against the interests of the tobacco industry. world no tobacco day was created in 1987 by the member states of the world health organization to draw the world s attention to the epidemic of smoking and preventable tobacco related diseases and deaths there are over 1 billion smokers in the world and 80 of them are in low and middle income countries where the effects of smoking related illnesses and deaths is highest current smokers are presumed to consume around 6 trillion cigarettes every year. 12.3. may 31st world no tobacco day federal law 12546 2011 in force since december 2014 was published and must be known and respected by all as well as be adequately enforced the health surveillance sectors in particular.601 data on vigitel released in april 2012 revealed a 14.8 drop in smokers in brazil in people over 18 years. among men the percentage of smokers was 18.1 and in women 12 . the capitals with the most smokers are porto alegre 23 curitiba 20 and s o paulo 19 and macei 8 jo o pessoa aracaju and salvador are the capitals with the lowest incidence of smoking in the northeast with 9 .602 there are strategies for tobacco control a prevention it is essential to prevent young people from trying cigarettes because if they do there is a 50 chance that they will become addicted. hence the importance of education from family and schools. enforcement of the anti smoking act which bans the advertisement of tobacco products and other actions directed at underage young people.603 b protection protect the population from the effects of environmental tobacco smoke and the influences that lead to smoking particularly those related to the social group. strictly enforce the anti smoking law which among other rules prohibited smoking in public environments.603 12.4. population aspects of obesity and overweight relationships between sociodemographic characteristics and lifestyle habits such as income socioeconomic status nutritional status and physical inactivity with weight gain have been established.604 610 in addition especially in the last two decades international authorities have strongly recommended the implementation of effective obesity prevention policies. however no country in the world has succeeded in reversing the obesity epidemic.611 612 a number of factors may explain the failure to combat obesity but perhaps the most important is the way it is still understood by most people. instead of being perceived as a chronic complex disease the result of the interaction of genetic and environmental variables strongly influenced by socio economic and cultural factors with a highly obesogenic environment obesity is seen as a personal failure. obese people are often blamed for their disease being judged lazy undisciplined unmotivated and negligent.611 612 from a population standpoint several measures have already been tested and found to be successful locally or for a predetermined period of time. the great challenge is to institute these measures in a more comprehensive and lasting way and to identify cultural and regional particularities that allow adaptations of these policies to each of the realities.613 614 interventions in schools are the most common and most promising precisely because of their educational and anti obesity character in the early stages of life. modifications in school lunches sedentary lifestyle health education are examples of measures that have been beneficial not only for the children and adolescents involved but also for adults in the same circle. fighting physical inactivity in an organized way with mass campaigns in addition to more regionalized actions focused on a particular exercise practice has also been shown to be beneficial for reducing obesity. there is also a lot of research focused on reducing the amount of physical activity required to achieve the weight reduction benefit. such studies arise precisely from the lack of time to devote to exercise which ends up being the justification for the sedentary lifestyle of most people.615 finally there are still population actions aimed at improving people s diets. such measures are extremely varied but ultimately use mostly financial interventions to target dietary choices and habits that are associated with overweight obesity. there are examples of taxing sweetened beverages financial incentives to purchase healthy foods types of financial penalties for buying unhealthy foods reductions in health care related health insurance costs and maintaining healthy diets.618 a concern that should be highlighted in view of population aging is the high prevalence of obesity in older populations. 862 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 such individuals should be evaluated very carefully since the identification of obesity is not so simple but mainly because of its association with musculoskeletal diseases diabetes and ami.619 12.5. population aspects of hypertension the treatment of hypertension is known to be effective in relation to the individual but from the population point of view it has been frustrating for many reasons.620 624 these begin with the lack of education in general and particularly in health which prevents knowledge about the disease and its importance as one of the main cv risk factors.594 599 they go through the difficulty of accessing health services for the correct diagnosis proper treatment with guidance on lifestyle and medication use and end with the great challenge of treatment compliance.620 624 these assumptions alone are sufficient to definitively indicate the actions that can effectively modify the natural history of hypertension and interfere with the equation cv risk morbidity and mortality. these actions at the collective level and focusing on primary and primordial prevention will have a great interface with other cvd risk factors.10 620 626 primordial prevention of risk factors and primary actions on installed risk factors prevention actions although presenting much better cost effective results demand more time for their appearance. for this reason huge amounts are spent on secondary or even primary prevention measures but with a focus on medicalization which in an misleading way shows favorable changes in short term statistics and may even give political results with immediatist benefits.10 620 626 it is evident that population intervention must involve the involvement of society as a whole. it should be part of a government policy and linked in a partnership with organized civil society non governmental organizations and industries in general especially food producers and beneficiaries. every action will only achieve the expected objectives if it is developed collectively with multidimensional action.10 620 626 it must be highlighted particularly for hypertension but has a strong interface with other cv risk factors education as a whole and in particular health education for the dissemination of knowledge about cv risk factors and the understanding of the importance of healthy lifestyles 10 620 626 legis lat ion enforcement which encourages the production of healthy foods and discourages and foods harmful to health 10 624 625 the encouragement of families to have healthy lifestyles with the possibility of monetary benefits in case of lifestyle changes maintenance of ideal weight decreased sodium intake regular physical activity increased fruit intake vegetables and cereals smoking cessation the provision of safe areas for the practice of regular physical activity provision of a simplified means for basic assessment of key cv risk factors bp body mass index blood glucose cholesterol and smoking status 2 620 access to basic medicines when preventive measures fail and the use of drugs to prevent disease is needed.10 620 12.6. population aspects of dyslipidemia scientific knowledge leaves no doubt about the relevance of dyslipidemias as an important risk cv factor.2 628 there is also a general recognition that individual or even collective actions aimed at treatment although useful and beneficial are very expensive and much lower cost effective even in developed countries.2 627 631 from these premises we have opened a huge door of opportunity. it is unthinkable to admit that the health system especially in developing countries such as brazil can adequately afford the high costs of treating established diseases.2 629 630 632 thus population based primary prevention becomes a cost effective and absolutely sustainable long term alternative.633 636 this must be the fundamental mission of any government. public policies for food quality control health education at all levels with priority for young people and finally a health system that allows universal access to care and when necessary drugs as the last option.633 637 638 it should be noted that small reductions in each of the risk factors may promote large reductions in cv events. additional benefit can be obtained through the adoption of healthy lifestyles in society that will bring benefits to all risk factors that are completely interconnected smoking poor diet overweight dyslipidemia ah and physical inactivity .632 634 636 thus the entire population with an initial focus on children and adolescents should be encouraged to adopt healthy diets maintain adequate weight or decrease weight for this purpose practice regular physical activity with at least moderate intensity and smoking cessation. the government should offer political legal and financial conditions for the implementation of these actions in the educational field for the entire population.2 627 628 636 12.6.1. general practice measures639 encourage exclusive breastfeeding up to at least 6 months decrease salt content in the preparation of processed and industrialized foods encourage the consumption of fruit and vegetables as well great supply and accessibility decrease intake of saturated and trans fats replacing with unsaturated fats decrease sugar content in industrialized beverages reduce food portion sizes and limit excessive caloric intake healthy food supply in all public institutions incentive and collaboration policies with producers for the production and commercialization of healthy foods incentives and continuous health education policy for the population as a whole with emphasis on children and adolescents improved labeling of processed and industrialized foods. 863 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 12.7. population aspects of physical activity physical activity includes all forms of human movement and active life including walking exercise as well as sports and is a natural behavior that confers many benefits.648 649 the urgency of addressing ncd including cvd which contribute to a significant burden of premature death disease disability and economic burden for all countries is emphasized.648 649 to reaffirm that physical inactivity is a major factor in modifiable risks to ncd. as an important point of the strategy to reduce the burden of ncd as articulated in the who global action plan for ncd prevention and control 2013 2020.627 648 649 recognizing this strong link between physical activity and major noncommunicable diseases who member states agreed on a relative 10 reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity by 2025 as one of nine global targets for improving the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases. in brazil according to vigitel 2017 physical activities practiced in four domains leisure occupational activity commuting and domestic activities which allow building multiple indicators of physical activity standard.650 in addition the frequency of adults who in their free time spend a three or more hours of the day watching television b three or more hours of the day using computer mobile or tablet and c three or more hours of the day watching television or using a computer mobile phone or tablet. the frequency of adults practicing leisure time physical activity equivalent to at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week ranged from 29.9 in s o paulo to 49.6 in the federal district. among men the highest frequencies were found in macap 57.1 s o lu s 54.1 and distrito federal 53.8 and the lowest in s o paulo 36.0 jo o pessoa. 39.5 and fortaleza 42.1 . among women the highest frequencies were observed in the federal district 45.9 palmas 41.9 and curitiba 37.7 . the smallest were in s o paulo 24.8 porto alegre 26.7 and recife 28.1 650 showing a high prevalence of sedentary individuals. physical activity in leisure time is increasing. in 2009 the indicator was 30.3 and in 2016 37.6 . prevalence decreases with age being more common among young people from 18 to 24 years old.650 the situation is not different from other countries whether developed or developing. prevalence in 2016 was more than twice as high in high income countries 36.8 35.0 38.3 than in low income countries 16.2 14.9 9.9 and physical inactivity increased in high income countries over time 31.6 27.1 37.2 in 2001 . if current trends continue the global physical activity target for 2025 a relative 10 reduction in physical inactivity will not be met. policies to increase population levels of physical activity need to be prioritized and expanded urgently.649 physical inactivity is one of the top 10 risk factors for global mortality causing about 3.2 million deaths each year.651 652 sedentary adults have a 20 30 increase in risk of all mortality causes compared with those who do at least 150 minutes of moderate physical activity per week or equivalent as recommended by who. regular physical activity reduces the risk of ischemic heart disease stroke diabetes and breast and colon cancer. in addition regular physical activity is a major determinant of energy expenditure and is therefore critical to energy balance weight control and obesity prevention.651 652 12.8. population approach to increased physical activity the proposed policy options aim to promote the implementation of the global strategy regarding diet physical activity and health and other relevant strategies and to promote the additional benefits of increasing physical activity levels in population such as improved educational performance and social and mental health benefits coupled with cleaner air reduced traffic less congestion and links to healthy child development and sustainable development.654 655 in addition interventions to increase participation in physical activity throughout the population for which favorable cost effectiveness data are emerging and should be promoted. the objective is to contribute to achieving the voluntary global goals listed below 654 655 a relative 10 reduction in the prevalence of physical inactivity. it can stop the rise of diabetes and obesity. lead to a 25 relative reduction in the prevalence of hypertension or contain the prevalence of increased bp according to national realities. proposed policy options include adopt and implement national guidelines on physical activity for health. consider establishing a multisectoral committee or similar body to provide strategic leadership and coordination. develop appropriate partnerships and involve all segments of society concerned levels of government non governmental organizations ngo civil society scientific societies and economic operators in the active and appropriate implementation of actions aimed at increasing physical activity at all ages. develop policy measures in cooperation with relevant sectors to promote physical activity through activities of daily living including through active transport recreation leisure and sport for example national state and municipal urban planning and transport policies to improve accessibility acceptability and safety of support infrastructure for walking and cycling. improvement in the provision of quality physical education in educational settings for elementary and high school students including opportunities for physical activity before during and after the formal school day. actions to support and encourage physical activity for all initiatives. creation and preservation of natural environments that facilitate physical activity in schools universities workplaces clinics and hospitals and in the wider community with a particular focus on providing infrastructure to support active transportation such as walking and cycling recreation and active play and participation in all types of sports. 864 updated

benefits of physical activity and facilitate healthy behaviors. campaigns should be linked to supportive actions across the community for maximum benefit and impact. encourage the evaluation of actions aimed at increasing physical activity to contribute to the development of an evidence base for effective and cost effective actions.654 655 12.9. socioeconomic and environmental factors and associated diseases in cardiovascular prevention the main determinants of population health are multiple and classifiable in the fields of biology environment physical social and economic behaviors lifestyle and health care.656 it is estimated that major socioeconomic determinants represent 75 while genetic biological and behavioral factors together account for approximately 25 of the population s health657 658 chart 12.1 . the literature reports different models that intend to describe the complex relationship between the multiple factors that influence the socioeconomic determinants of health one of the most mentioned is the dahlgren and whitehead659 model figure 12.4 . according to rose 660 the socioeconomic determinants underlie the pyramid of health inequalities and consequently the right to health cannot be guaranteed only by the health sector requiring economic and social public policies.660 prospective studies have shown that in brazil and in developed countries low socioeconomic status defined as low status employment low educational and income levels and living in poorer residential areas contribute to increased cv mortality and all cause death.664 668 through

association between the indicator and mortality rates showing the importance of improving the living conditions of the population in the reduction of cv mortality.664 the american heart association document on the influence of social factors on cvd revealed that populations with lower educational levels have a higher prevalence of cv risk factors a higher incidence of cv events and a higher cv mortality rate regardless of other demographic factors.665 12.10. health and sustainable development health is a timeless value. good health is a precondition for work and a measure of sustainable development.666 the who created the commission of social determinants of health in 2005 to define health promotion directed at health equity in populations and a global movement to reach it. in an extensive evidence based publication who prioritized the following actions early childhood education healthy housing urban and rural infrastructure universal access to health and other services employment quality social protection inclusion social gender equality. regardless of policy options it advocated health equity in all policies systems and programs through fair financing and good global governance . it recommended as an example the united nations un millennium project prepared in 2000 during the millennium summit the largest meeting of world leaders aimed at establishing a global partnership to reduce extreme poverty.667 668 the 2015 goals known as the millennium development goals mdg represented a paradigm shift to improve the health of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. they are eradicate extreme poverty and hunger implement a universal basic education promote gender equality and empower women reduce child mortality improve maternal health combat aids malaria and other infectious diseases ensure environmental sustainability and develop a global partnership for development. subsequently in 2015 the who health report health in 2015 from mgds to sdgs

context brazil launched the strategic action plan for coping with ncd in brazil 2011 2022 at the un assembly and implemented a cncd surveillance system vigitel over the last decade that allows the national and global monitoring of ncd targets representing a breakthrough in ncd surveillance in the country.670 between 2000 and 2011 brazil recorded an average decline of 2.5 per annum in all major ncd with a significant decrease of 3.3 in cvd observed in both sexes and in all regions of the country.671 however between 2015 and 2016 there was a trend of stability in mortality rates due to ncd which may be a consequence of the change in risk factor behavior and worsening of risk factors living conditions access to services unemployment caused by the economic and the social crisis.672 673 if these trends are maintained brazil may not meet the who un target set for the reduction in premature mortality from ncd in agenda 2030. 12.11. cardiovascular prevention environment sustainability and associated diseases hippocrates the author of airs waters and places 400 bc was probably the first to recognize a relationship between disease and the environment including the effects of climate and lifestyle.674 numerous aspects regardinf the quality of the physical environment air pollution cycle paths green areas parks and behavioral factors smoking high fat diets physical inactivity are determining factors for increasing or decreasing risks for cvd.675 since 2004 the american heart association has recognized exposure to air pollution as an important modifiable risk factor for cvd morbidity and mortality in populations with a higher risk attributable to particulate matter pm over gaseous components.676 particulate matter 2.5 m pm2.5 is the most important environmental risk factor with higher risk than gaseous components posing a major threat to public health.677 short term pm2.5 elevations increase the relative risk of acute cv events by 1 to 3 within a few days. long term exposures years increase the risk by 10 which is partly attributable to the development of cardiometabolic disorders such as high blood pressure diabetes mellitus among others.677 866 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology 2019 arq bras cardiol. 2019 113 4 787 891 the pathophysiological mechanisms of changes caused by pm include increased

progression of atherosclerosis.678 the harvard six cities study involving populations from six us cities revealed that the risk of myocardial infarction in a city with polluted air increases by 5 compared with that of clean air.679 in the city of s o paulo it was observed that pollution is so high that it would be the equivalent to smoking two cigarettes a day.677 in the brazilian amazon burning biomass bush increased mortality from cv and respiratory events among the elderly especially from acute myocardial infarction.680 particles and gases released at high altitudes circulate throughout the troposphere and can be transported over long distances with impacts on a global scale.680 after forest fires in canada high concentrations up to 30 times higher of mostly fine pm have been recorded in the city of baltimore in the united states. thus environmental threats are not limited only to industrial gases and lead particles from motor vehicles in urban areas but also to the pm generated by biomass burning in rural areas and it is estimated that air pollution a growing public health problem will double cvd mortality by 2050.680 the expert position paper on air pollution and cardiovascular disease of the european society of cardiology revealed that in 2010 air pollution accounted for 3.1 million of the 52.8 million deaths for all causes and ages. the american heart association reports that 60 000 americans and 6 000 canadians die each year from short or long term exposure to airborne pollutants.681 study shows that living near 50 m high traffic roads can increase risk sudden death.682 other factors related to lifestyle eating habits and socioeconomic variables may exacerbate the effects of exposure to pollution such as smoking a diet high in fats and sugars physical inactivity and the use of licit alcohol and illicit marijuana drugs. the key recommendations of the environment the heart campaign campaign organized in 2015 by the european society of cardiology and the european heart network ehn to european policy makers to promote a healthy environment for a healthy heart were 1 include the air and noise pollution in the group of modifiable risk factors for cvd 2 include clean air and noise reduction in all areas of health policy 3 adopt who air quality limits 4 intensely reduce the emission of automotive gases 5 promote green urban planning to reduce pollution and promote physical activity 6 promote clean forms of energy low emission vehicles and non combustion renewable energy sources 7 guarantee funds for studies on the effects of environmental stress on the cv system 8 support events addressing ncd social economic and environmental inequalities regarding access to health.683 684 brian garvey685 from the university of strathclyde scotland in the preface to larissa bombardi s study geography of pesticides in brazil and connections with the european union stated that every sick community every poisoned field every polluted watercourse threatens to extinguish an alternative variety of life . the major steps in developing an action plan for addressing cv disease risk factors 686 are described in figure 12.5. 12.12. conclusion commitment from universities scientific societies organized civil society state and municipal health secretariats state and municipal education secretariats the ministry of health and federal state and municipal governments is necessary to implement population based approaches to address cv disease risk factors. these actions should be state policies aimed at impacting the various related morbidity and mortality indicators as well as improving the population s quality of life. 867 updated updated cardiovascular prevention guideline of the brazilian society of cardiology

september 2015 this systematic review was conducted in coordination with two other systematic reviews1 2 and a decision model3 to support the u.s. preventive services task force uspstf in making updated clinical preventive service recommendations for aspirin in primary prevention. the original literature searches were completed in june 2014. in order to prepare a set of manuscripts derived from these reviews we conducted updated literature searches through january 6 2015 to identify newly published information since the original searches. a single open label randomized controlled clinical trial in a cardiovascular disease cvd primary prevention population the japanese primary prevention project jppp 4 was the only additional clinical research report located through the updated searches that met inclusion exclusion criteria for any of the reviews. outcomes from this study nonfatal myocardial infarction mi nonfatal stroke nonfatal cerebral infarction intracranial hemorrhage and undefined cardiovascular events cvd mortality fatal mi cerebral infarction intracranial hemorrhage subarachnoid hemorrhage and other fatal cardiovascular events hemorrhagic stroke fatal and nonfatal intracranial hemorrhage and all cause mortality were incorporated into the final evidence reviewed by the uspstf and resulted in updated inputs into the decision analysis. this systematic review has not been updated to reflect the incorporation of results from jppp. updated results are reflected in the manuscript derived from this review which is available for public comment at http www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org. results for this systematic review for outcomes unrelated to those reported in jppp are current through january 6 2015. no further updated literature searches

annually. purpose to systematically review evidence for the effectiveness of aspirin to prevent myocardial infarction mi coronary events stroke cardiovascular death and all cause mortality in those without a history of cvd. to review evidence for harms associated with aspirin use. data sources we searched medline pubmed and the cochrane collaboration registry of controlled trials to identify literature that was published between january 2008 and june 2014. we supplemented our searches with reference lists from the previous review relevant existing systematic reviews suggestions from experts and clinicaltrials.gov to identify ongoing trials. study selection two investigators independently reviewed identified abstracts and full text articles against a set of a priori inclusion and quality criteria. data analysis one investigator abstracted data into an evidence table and a second investigator checked these data. we conducted mantel haenszel fixed effects meta analyses to estimate the effect size of aspirin chemoprevention in preventing mi coronary events stroke cvd related death and all cause mortality. additionally we conducted sensitivity analyses using peto odds ratios. we qualitatively synthesized the harms related to major gastrointestinal gi bleeding hemorrhagic stroke and age related macular degeneration to estimate the harms associated with aspirin use. results we included 10 fair to good quality randomized controlled trials rcts n 103 787 examining the effectiveness of aspirin for the primary prevention of cvd. aspirin reduces the risk of major cvd events total mi total stroke cvd mortality by 11 percent relative risk rr 0.89 95 confidence interval ci 0.84 to 0.95 which appears to be largely driven by a 20 percent reduction in nonfatal mi coronary events rr 0.80 95 ci 0.72 to 0.88 . aspirin s effectiveness in reducing nonfatal mi coronary events that were reported in trials of doses ranging from 100 mg every other day to 650 mg daily were also seen with trials using 100 mg or less daily. while primary prevention trials for doses 100 mg every other day to 650 mg daily demonstrated no reduction in stroke events with aspirin use trials using 100 mg daily or less showed a reduction in total stroke rr 0.85 95 ci 0.76 to 0.96 . cvd mortality was unchanged with the use of aspirin in these 10 trials. all cause mortality may be unchanged or slightly reduced with a statistically significant benefit not persistent in dose sensitivity analyses. all trials were powered for cvd composite outcomes. increasing age being associated with greater rr reductions was the only consistent subgroup trend we identified. trials of patients with diabetes showed no cvd benefit and trials with diabetes subgroup analyses showed no effect modification in this group. given the paucity of data we can draw no conclusions about treatment benefit modification based on aspirin formulation or duration. aspirin s cvd benefit appears to begin within the first 5 years of administration there are limited data for longer durations. we included nine of these rcts to examine the major gi bleeding harms hemorrhagic stroke and other harms associated with aspirin use. major gi bleeding was reported variably in the nine trials with rrs ranging from 0.50 to 8.10. an individual participant data aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events iv kaiser permanente research affiliates epc meta analysis reported a 50 percent increase in major gi bleeding and other extracranial bleeding rr 1.54 95 ci 1.30 to 1.82 with aspirin use compared to controls. seven trials reported hemorrhagic stroke as rare events 5 incidence in both aspirin and control groups making the numbers too unstable to precisely estimate the effect of aspirin on this harm. two rcts found no statistically significant difference in age related macular degeneration in the aspirin group compared to controls. both trials showed rrs of less than 1. conclusions in primary prevention populations aspirin modestly reduces nonfatal mi coronary events and major cvd events but also increases major gi bleeding risk. more precise real world estimates for bleeding events including major gi bleeding events and hemorrhagic stroke are necessary to calculate the net benefit. at some absolute risk for 10 year cvd events this absolute cvd benefit could potentially outweigh the bleeding risks. models to identify these populations are needed. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events v kaiser permanente research affiliates epc abbreviations aaa aspirin for

additional tables aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events xi kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 1. introduction prevalence heart disease is the leading cause of mortality in the united states for both men and women.1 while the relative rate of cardiovascular disease cvd mortality declined by 31 percent from 2000 to 2010 the burden of disease remains high with cvd accounting for about one in three deaths in the united states.2 in addition to high rates of mortality many persons live with a cvd diagnosis 16 million and a large number of individuals are survivors of cvd related events such as heart attack 7.9 million or stroke 7 million .3 each year an estimated 620 000 americans have a first heart attack and about 610 000 experience a first stroke.2 these high rates of cvd mortality and morbidity represent a significant economic burden to the health care system in the united states. in 2010 for example the estimated direct and indirect cost of cvd was approximately 315 billion.2 burden while cvd impacts much of the population the distribution of burden and risk factors is not equal among subpopulations. age sex and race ethnicity are nonmodifiable risk factors that are associated with an increased burden of cvd in the united states. the prevalence of cvd including heart disease stroke and other vascular diseases increases progressively with age with a lifetime risk for any cvd of almost two in three for men and greater than one in two for women who are free of disease at age 45 years.4 2010 u.s. based data showed that individuals age 65 years or older carry the highest prevalence of coronary heart disease chd 19.8 with those ages 45 to 64 and 18 to 44 years having a prevalence of 7.1 and 1.2 percent respectively.5 men also bear a higher burden of heart disease than women with higher incidence at each age strata2 and prevalence rates of 7.8 and 4.6 percent respectively.5 while men carry a higher burden of heart disease women experience higher mortality from certain cardiovascular incidents such as stroke.2 one cause of this difference is that men tend to experience cvd events earlier in life. for myocardial infarction mi the mean age of first event is 64.9 years for men and 72.3 years for women.2 perhaps due to their increased age at first mi women are more likely than men to die within weeks of having an mi.2 in addition to age and sex differences race and ethnicity are also associated with an increased burden of chd. from 2006 to 2010 american indians and alaska natives had the highest prevalence 11.6 of heart disease followed by blacks 6.5 hispanics 6.1 whites 5.8 and asians or native hawaiians other pacific islanders 3.9 .5 cvd risk factors and risk assessment risk factors for cvd are well established and include both modifiable and nonmodifiable components. modifiable risk factors include high cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes overweight and obesity smoking lack of physical activity and unhealthy diet.6 8 nonmodifiable risk factors include age sex and family history.6 7 9 10 aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 1 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc diabetes is an important risk factor as prevalence of diabetes is increasing in the u.s. population and patients with diabetes incur a greater risk for heart disease than those without diabetes. in 2010 for example 8.3 percent of the general population and 26.9 percent of those age 65 years or older had been diagnosed with diabetes mellitus and these prevalence rates are increasing dramatically.2 11 this high prevalence of diabetes especially among older populations is noteworthy because adults with diabetes are at a two to four fold risk for cvd events compared with those without diabetes.11 13 there are a number of chd and cvd risk assessment tools available to clinicians and patients.6 8 14 22 these tools are based on risk prediction equations derived from large prospective cohort studies randomized trials and primary care databases. investigators have cited several sources of heterogeneity among risk assessment tools including the definition of chd or cvd outcomes predicted risk factors included and variation in the baseline risk and other characteristics of model derivation cohorts.23 24 these differences in tools can lead to different risk scores in the same patient.24 characteristics of these tools are provided in appendix a. the american college of cardiology american heart association acc aha pooled cohort equation14 and one of the six framingham based models by anderson25 predict global cvd outcomes and have been externally validated in u.s. based populations. models predicting chd that have been externally validated in u.s. based populations include those based on framingham data by anderson 26 wilson 8 and the adult treatment panel atp iii.15 no stroke prediction model has been externally validated in the united states appendix e table 5 . mechanism of action while aspirin has long been used as a pain reliever it began to gain traction as an effective antiplatelet drug therapy during the 1980s as clinical trials showed promising results.27 over the past two decades researchers gained insights into the mechanism of aspirin and its use as an anticlotting agent to prevent the development of cvd. this research has revealed that atherosclerosis associated with cvd causes narrowing of the arteries and blood vessels through the thickening of the arterial wall which may lead to reduced blood flow to the tissues and organs of the body.28 additionally plaques may form in these narrowed vessels and break or rupture causing blood clots that can block blood flow to the heart or brain resulting in a heart attack or stroke.28 aspirin therapy helps to reduce these blood clots and because of this is often prescribed as a primary or secondary preventive measure for persons at high risk for mi coronary events or stroke. aspirin belongs to the family of nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs nsaids and has been determined to be an irreversible cyclo oxygenase cox 1 and 2 enzyme inhibitor although unlike other nsaids it affects more of the cox 1 variant than cox 2.29 when used in low doses 100 mg day aspirin works by preferentially inhibiting cox 1 activity which results in a decreased production of thromboxane a2.30 thromboxane promotes platelet clotting and vasoconstriction which explains aspirin s anticlotting effects.29 with low doses of aspirin throughout this process cox 2 activity remains intact which allows prostaglandin i2 a aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 2 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc vasodilator and platelet inhibitor to continue to be produced. cox 2 typically helps to produce prostanoids the majority of which are proinflammatory and are an important part of the inflammatory response system.31 this resulting decrease in thromboxane a2 and continued production of prostaglandin i2 explains aspirin s potential ability to diminish arterial thrombosis and prevent mi coronary events and stroke.29 the cox 1 enzyme is also responsible for producing a variety of prostaglandins some of which are actively involved in protecting the gastrointestinal gi mucosa.32 by inhibiting this enzyme aspirin use can leave the patient vulnerable to gi bleeding which is a major harm to consider when weighing the benefits of regular aspirin therapy.29 at higher doses 300 mg day aspirin begins to inhibit cox 2 activity taking on greater anti inflammatory effects but also increases the inhibition of prostaglandins produced by cox 1 further increasing the risk of gi bleeding in the patient.29 31 current clinical practice in the united states research has demonstrated that aspirin therapy can effectively reduce the recurrence of serious vascular events in patients with a history of a previous mi stroke or transient ischemic attack tia by approximately 20 percent.33 because of this consistently reported benefit which has been found to significantly outweigh the risk of major bleeding aspirin therapy for secondary prevention has gained widespread clinical acceptance.33 34 the potential benefit of aspirin in primary prevention however is smaller because of the lower absolute risk in this population.33 therefore many recommendations have focused on identifying primary prevention patients at sufficiently high cvd risk to outweigh bleeding harms. as illustrated in appendix e table 1 u.s. based recommendations published more than 3 years ago by the u.s. preventive services task force uspstf 35 aha 36 and american diabetes association37 recommend aspirin for patients meeting various cvd chd risk thresholds. in contrast european recommendations published more recently38 41 do not recommend the use of aspirin in primary prevention with the exception of a weak consideration from the united kingdom s national institute for health and care excellence for use in patients with hypertension age 50 years or older with a greater than 20 percent 10 year cvd risk or reduced renal function. the centers for disease control and prevention released data from 2007 2008 that demonstrates that physicians prescribed aspirin and other antiplatelet medications at relatively few visits in the population recommended by the uspstf 16.2 percent in men and 21.7 percent in women.3 possible reasons for low uptake of the recommendation could include lack of knowledge about guidelines competing demands during the clinical encounter or the expectation that patients will not adhere to advice. previous uspstf recommendations in 2002 the uspstf found good evidence from five randomized controlled trials rcts that aspirin decreases the incidence of chd in adults at increased risk for heart disease.42 it also found good evidence that aspirin increases the incidence of gi bleeding and fair evidence that aspirin increases the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. the uspstf concluded that the balance of benefits and harms is most favorable in patients at high risk for chd those with a 5 year risk aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 3 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc 3 but is also influenced by patient preferences. as a result the uspstf strongly recommended that clinicians discuss aspirin with adults who are at increased risk for chd.42 in contrast to the 2002 recommendations in 2009 the uspstf concluded that there was evidence to support variations in aspirin use by age and sex.35 based on data from six rcts the uspstf concluded there was good evidence that aspirin decreases the risk of mi coronary events in men and ischemic strokes in women. it also concluded there was good evidence that aspirin increases the risk of gi bleeding and fair evidence that aspirin increases the incidence of hemorrhagic stroke. the uspstf determined that overall reduction in cvd events with aspirin use is dependent on both baseline cvd risk specifically chd risk in men and stroke risk in women and risk for gi bleeding.35 the uspstf found insufficient evidence to assess the balance of risks and benefits in men and women age 80 years or older. there was modest certainty that the benefits of reducing mi coronary events or ischemic stroke do not outweigh harms in men age 44 years or younger and women age 54 years or younger. as a result the uspstf recommended aspirin use for men ages 45 to 79 years for prevention of mi and for women ages 55 to 79 years for prevention of ischemic stroke when the potential benefit outweighs the risk of an increase in gi hemorrhage. the uspstf recommended against treatment in men and women age 80 years or older and did not issue a recommendation for men age 44 years or younger or women age 54 years or younger.35 since the previous review results are now available from three new trials conducted in populations selected for diabetes asymptomatic peripheral artery disease or both.43 45 aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 4 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 2. methods scope and purpose this systematic review will provide updated evidence regarding the benefits and harms of aspirin for the primary prevention of cardiovascular events. the uspstf will use this review to update its 2009 recommendation on this topic.35 this review included all trials from the previous review that met current inclusion and exclusion criteria as well as newly identified studies. key questions and analytic framework using the uspstf s methods detailed in appendix b 46 we developed an analytic framework figure 1 and two key questions kqs in consultation with the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq medical officer and three members of the uspstf. these kqs were adapted from questions addressed in the previous review.35 kqs 1. does regular aspirin use in patients without known cvd reduce mi stroke death from mi or stroke or all cause mortality a. does the effect vary between a priori subgroups age sex smoking status race ethnicity 10 year cardiovascular risk or related risk conditions e.g. diabetes mellitus decreased ankle brachial index abi or elevated blood pressure b. does the effect vary by dose formulation i.e. enteric coated or duration of aspirin use 2. does regular aspirin use increase gi bleeding hemorrhagic stroke or other serious harms e.g. age related macular degeneration armd a. does the effect vary between a priori subgroups age sex smoking status race ethnicity 10 year cardiovascular risk related risk conditions e.g. diabetes mellitus decreased abi or elevated blood pressure gi bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke risk factors including history of gi bleeding ulcers or nsaid use or concomitant medication use nsaids selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or proton pump inhibitors ppis b. does the effect vary by dose formulation or duration of aspirin use data sources and searches in addition to considering all studies from the previous review for inclusion in the current review we performed a comprehensive search of medline pubmed and the cochrane collaboration registry of controlled trials for studies published between january 2008 and june 3 2014. we worked with a medical librarian to develop our search strategy appendix b . all searches were limited to articles published in the english language. we managed literature search results using version 12.0 of reference manager thomson reuters new york ny a bibliographic management software database. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 5 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc to ensure comprehensiveness of our retrieval strategy we reviewed the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews and meta analyses to identify relevant articles that were published before the timeframe of or not identified in our literature searches. we also obtained references from outside experts. in addition we searched federal agency trial registries for ongoing trials appendix d . study selection two reviewers independently reviewed the title and abstracts of all identified articles to determine if the study met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for design population intervention and outcomes appendix b table 1 . two reviewers then independently evaluated the full text article s of all potentially relevant studies against the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria. disagreements in the abstract and or full text review were resolved by discussion and consultation with a third reviewer if necessary. excluded studies and reasons for exclusion are listed in appendix c. we developed an a priori set of criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies based on criteria from the previous review and our understanding of the literature appendix b table 1 . for both kqs we considered studies examining the primary prevention of cvd i.e. mi or stroke in adults age 40 years or older. we excluded studies that included adult populations with an existing cvd diagnosis heart failure previous stroke previous mi tia angina or previous bypass or angioplasty atrial fibrillation or hypercoagulable disorders. in addition we did not consider studies in patients with familial hypercholesterolemia and other selected nongeneralizable populations. we included studies examining regular oral aspirin use minimum of 75 mg every other day compared to no treatment or a placebo. we excluded interventions including nonaspirin antithrombotic medications aspirin as a cotreatment to another active intervention and nonoral or nontablet forms of aspirin. in addition we excluded studies that did not provide information on the dose of aspirin used or if limited to irregular or occasional aspirin use only. for kq 1 effectiveness of aspirin we considered rcts or controlled clinical trials reporting mi coronary events fatal and nonfatal stroke fatal and nonfatal all cause mortality and quality of life. for kq 2 harms of aspirin we considered rcts controlled clinical trials or observational studies i.e. cohort or case control studies reporting gi bleeding hemorrhagic stroke fatal and nonfatal or other serious harms e.g. armd . individual patient data ipd meta analyses provide unique data that complement existing trial data particularly for subpopulations. ipd meta analyses were not pooled with primary trials due to double counting but were discussed in relevant results sections when they provided data on subpopulations not available elsewhere. for both kqs we required a minimum of 1 year duration of aspirin treatment and study followup. we limited our included studies to those published in english and rated as good or fair quality using uspstf quality rating standards.47 we excluded studies that were rated as poor quality and those that did not publish results in english. the outcomes that were reviewed are fully listed in appendix b table 1. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 6 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc quality assessment two reviewers independently assessed the methodological quality of each study using predefined criteria developed by the uspstf47 and supplemented with the national institute for health and care excellence methodology checklists for observational studies.48 disagreements in quality were resolved by discussion. each study was given a final quality rating of good fair or poor. good quality rcts had adequate randomization procedures and allocation concealment blinded outcome assessment reliable outcome measures similar groups at baseline i.e. little to no statistically significant differences between groups in baseline characteristics low attrition 90 of participants had followup data with 10 percentage point difference in loss to followup between groups used intention to treat analysis and reported diagnostic criteria for outcome ascertainment. trials were downgraded to fair quality if they were unable to meet the majority of the good quality criteria. we rated trials as poor quality if attrition was greater than 40 percent or differed between groups by 20 percentage points or if there were any other fatal flaws that seriously affected internal validity as agreed upon by two independent investigators. we did not rate any trials as poor however based on these criteria. data extraction one reviewer extracted data from all included studies rated as fair or good quality into a standard evidence table microsoft excel microsoft corporation redmond wa and a second reviewer checked data for accuracy. elements abstracted included population characteristics e.g. baseline demographics including cvd risk factors concurrent conditions and medication use i.e. antihypertension medications lipid lowering agents selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ppis h2 blockers or nsaids history of gi ulcers or treatment for helicobacter pylori study design e.g. recruitment procedures inclusion exclusion criteria followup and adherence intervention characteristics i.e. aspirin dose duration formulation and administration time and outcomes as specified in the inclusion and exclusion criteria. health outcomes included the number and rate of participants experiencing an event and measures of association where reported adjustments for confounders were noted as appropriate. for kq 1 effectiveness of aspirin we abstracted the reported primary composite cvd outcomes from each included trial describing in detail what elements composed each composite outcome. in addition we abstracted fatal and nonfatal mi coronary and stroke events separating by stroke type where reported. furthermore cvd related and all cause mortality data were abstracted for each included trial. for kq 2 harms of aspirin we abstracted bleeding events with a focus on gi bleeding intracranial bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. data synthesis and analysis after the abstraction of data into evidence tables we audited the outcomes reported across trials to assess heterogeneity of reporting. we identified 24 eligible outcomes including variations for aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 7 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc fatal nonfatal and total events per category that we prioritized into four primary outcomes based on a priori decisions from the criteria and the availability consistency of outcome reporting across trials 1 composite of death from mi coronary events stroke and cvd 2 nonfatal stroke 3 nonfatal mi coronary events and 4 all cause mortality. seven secondary outcomes were also identified 1 total stroke 2 total mi coronary events 3 fatal mi coronary events 4 composite of fatal mi coronary events and fatal stroke 5 composite of nonfatal mi coronary events and nonfatal stroke 6 composite of mi coronary events and stroke fatal and nonfatal combined with cvd mortality and 7 cvd composites identified by the trial. because of substantial heterogeneity in the definition of trials primary composite outcomes and the fact that these composites included outcomes that were not eligible for our review i.e. angina revascularization or not related to the aspirin pathway i.e. abdominal aortic aneurysm heart failure pulmonary embolism we constructed our own primary composite outcome of fatal mi coronary events fatal stroke and cardiovascular death. when this outcome was not reported in primary studies we combined fatal stroke fatal mi coronary events and cardiovascular death. we also analyzed these outcomes individually. we defined fatal mi fatal coronary events as fatal acute mi sudden death international classification of disease icd 9 code 798 sudden death cause unknown and all death attributable to ischemic heart disease ihd icd 9 codes 410 414 . where possible we excluded abdominal aortic aneurysm heart failure and pulmonary embolism from the cardiovascular death composite. in some cases however these events were not reported separately and as a result it was possible that such events contributed to a trial s reported cardiovascular death composite. we assumed that these other causes of cvd related mortality would represent few contributing events this approach was preferable to excluding such trials in the analysis for the composite cvd mortality outcome. when not reported we calculated nonfatal fatal events by subtracting fatal nonfatal events from total events for an outcome category. stroke type was not calculated from total stroke and another stroke type i.e. calculate ischemic by subtracting hemorrhagic from total unless the study reported that all strokes were ascertained or reported stroke of unknown type. if a combination of outcomes were not reported in a trial i.e. total stroke we added together its components where possible i.e. fatal and nonfatal stroke . for multifactorial trials with additional randomization to vitamins antioxidants or placebo we combined groups as there was no evidence of interaction and evidence from systematic reviews supports that vitamins do not reduce the incidence of cvd.49 in a trial with additional randomization to warfarin or placebo we did not include these arms as we considered warfarin a cotreatment that we excluded per inclusion criteria. we limited our analysis of bleeding to major gi bleeding defined as gi bleeding requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death. if a trial reported transfusions and death from gi bleeding separately we added these events together. if a trial only reported deaths from gi bleeding we used that number for major gi bleeding we recognize that these event rates will appear low compared to other studies also reporting nonfatal major gi bleeding . if a trial reported gi bleeding without any mention of severity we did not include it in our analysis. while we considered minor gi bleeding bleeding from other sites and other serious harms they are discussed in an accompanying systematic review.50 aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 8 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc because these studies were conducted in relatively healthy primary prevention populations most outcomes were rare i.e. generally 10 of participants experienced any given event and 1 to 2 for some outcomes . because of rare events the mantel haenszel fixed effects model was chosen as the primary statistical analysis method.51 sensitivity analyses were conducted using the peto odds ratio or method.52 we assessed statistical heterogeneity using the i2 statistic. we assessed small study bias using funnel plots and peters test of bias for the four primary outcomes. none of these outcomes demonstrated a statistically significant relationship between effect size and study precision. the power was limited for these tests however because only nine to 10 studies were included for these outcomes. forest plots show adjusted values for relative risks rrs when primary studies adjusted for confounders along with the mantel haenszel pooled estimate. when measures of association were not reported we calculated these measures using the number of individuals and the numbers of events in each randomized group. we used unadjusted values for sensitivity analyses using peto ors because of software programming limitations. when events were reported as per unit of patient years and the number of patient years in each group was reported we calculated the number of events in each group. given the small number of included trials we chose not to pool several outcomes because of very small absolute numbers of events which we believed could result in unstable and potentially misleading effect estimates. although the outcomes we pooled were also rare events large samples ensured that trials found at least 10 or more events in each treatment arm for most pooled outcomes. we did not pool outcomes however when a substantial number of trials reported fewer than 10 events in one or both treatment arms. we did not pool fatal stroke for example because of small numbers of events six of nine contributing studies had fewer than 10 events in one or both groups. in contrast we pooled the fatal mi coronary event outcome which had 10 contributing trials with only two having fewer than 10 events in each group. we did include the forest plots of outcomes we did not pool in a visual display of the data. we used first event analyses when trials reported both first and total event analyses. we chose this more conservative approach because after a first event patients are more likely to have a second event in the same category. these patients are likely being treated for secondary prevention with other potentially confounding medical management such as lipid therapy and administration of beta blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. we identified both heterogeneity and a lack of reporting across trials regarding whether analyses were first event only or whether multiple events were allowed within or across outcome categories. in order to explore the impact of heterogeneity in population characteristics and aspirin dose we conducted sensitivity analyses to exclude four trials of special populations with diabetes abnormal abi or both and aspirin doses of 325 mg or greater and greater than 100 mg. forest plots were created that show daily aspirin dose. for trials using alternate day dosing we divided the alternate day dose by two to generate the daily dose. additionally funnel plots were created to explore publication bias. we did not pool the results of ipd meta analyses with primary trials to avoid double counting. we discuss the results of these analyses separately. when results from long term observational aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 9 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc followup were reported these were not pooled as followup was not randomized for the entire period. we addressed the results from these analyses qualitatively. subpopulation methods we prespecified subpopulations of interest in the kqs. these populations were selected based on analysis of subpopulation considerations in the previous review and recommendation established characteristics associated with cardiovascular and or bleeding risk and subpopulations addressed in authoritative existing systematic reviews. during the data abstraction phase we catalogued the availability and characteristics of subgroup analyses i.e. whether analyses were a priori post hoc or unclear for each subpopulation of interest for each trial and subsequently audited these results appendix e table 2 . using this audit formal subgroup analyses were prioritized based on the number of contributing studies and the credibility of subgroup analyses with subpopulation specific trials and a priori analyses given more weight. we then entered data from subgroup analyses into evidence tables and further into summary tables for the prioritized analyses of sex age and diabetes. in addition to outcomes subgroup summary tables included information relevant to the credibility of each trial s subgroup analyses including timing of the analysis interaction testing for heterogeneity of treatment effect and if relevant diagnostic criteria for the subgroup of interest. direct evidence from within study comparisons was emphasized over across study comparisons which can be confounded by differences in populations and their risk factors. based on a limited number of contributing studies for subgroup analyses we did not pool results and instead analyzed them qualitatively. expert review and public comment a draft of the analytic framework kqs and inclusion exclusion criteria was posted on the uspstf web site for public comment from july 11 2013 to august

kq 1. does regular aspirin use in patients without known cvd reduce mi stroke death from mi or stroke or all cause mortality summary of results based on a meta analysis of the 10 primary prevention aspirin rcts aspirin appears to have a statistically significant although modest benefit on nonfatal mi coronary events. it also showed a benefit for the composite outcomes of nonfatal stroke combined with nonfatal mi coronary events and total stroke combined with total mi coronary events including cvd death . these composite findings were again largely driven by the reduction in nonfatal mi coronary events. all cause mortality may be unchanged or slightly reduced with aspirin the statistically significant modest reduction was not persistent with sensitivity analyses in lower doses nor was it seen in an ipd meta analysis. a pooled analysis that only included low dose aspirin trials 100 mg day showed a modest reduction in total stroke while still retaining much of the nonfatal mi benefit. all 10 trials were powered for composite outcomes making it difficult to determine if the nonstatistically significant findings with some individual outcomes were due to lack of power. each of the trials recruited participants from unique patient subpopulations thereby making pooling potentially less useful for clinical application. trial characteristics ten major rcts n 103 787 two good

optimal treatment hot trial was a 3x2 factorial design wherein patients were initially randomized to one of three diastolic blood pressure targets then each of the target blood pressure groups were randomized to aspirin or placebo.56 the 10 primary prevention rcts randomized a total of 103 787 participants with individual trial sizes ranging from 1 276 to 39 876 participants. the largest two trials were substantially larger than any other trials and both funded by the national institutes of health the women s health study whs included more than 39 000 participants and its male counterpart the physicians health study phs included more than 22 000 participants.53 58 overall followup times in the trials ranged from 3.6 to 10.1 years. ppp had the shortest followup time of less than 4 years.59 the aspirin for asymptomatic atherosclerosis aaa trial and whs had the longest followup times of 8 and 10 years respectively.45 58 seven of the trials administered aspirin at a dosage of 100 mg or less daily or every other day 43 45 54 56 58 59 one trial used 325 mg every other day 53 one used 500 mg daily 57 and one used 650 mg daily.55 half of the studies specified tablet formulation two used enteric coated45 59 and three trials used other or unspecified formulations.43 44 56 control groups received placebo 44 45 53 56 58 nothing 43 59 or were advised to avoid aspirin products.57 cotreatments included betacarotene 53 antioxidant combination alpha tocopherol ascorbic acid pyridoxine hydrochloride zinc sulphate nicotinamide lecithin and sodium selenite 44 vitamin e 58 59 or warfarin.54 almost all of the trials were government sponsored with the exception of hot and the british medical doctor s bmd trial which were industry sponsored.56 57 primary outcomes for seven trials were cardiovascular event composites which involved combining cardiovascular mortality events and nonfatal events defined variably 43 45 54 56 58 59 two trials primary outcomes were cardiovascular mortality event composites 53 57 and one trial s primary outcome was all cause mortality.55 secondary outcomes generally included several of the following event rates for individual outcomes of fatal stroke nonfatal stroke fatal mi nonfatal mi cardiovascular mortality or all cause mortality. eight studies specified stroke etiology as hemorrhagic versus ischemic.43 45 53 54 57 59

pulmonary embolism abdominal aortic aneurysm or hypertensive disease. events were ascertained using a combination of death certificates national registries hospital and outpatient records autopsies when available and physician and patient questionnaires. independent blinded endpoint committees confirmed events in all trials. phs and whs had run in periods of 12 to 18 weeks.53 58 compliance with aspirin therapy in the intervention group was variably reported and ascertained from participant questionnaires in the eight studies reporting compliance. the thrombosis prevention trial tpt was the only trial that used pill counts or salicylate levels to measure compliance crossover. at 5 years phs bmd and etdrs reported 70 to 89 percent of participants taking aspirin or other platelet affecting drugs.53 55 57 despite tpt s nearly 50 percent withdrawal rate those continuing in both groups missed only 2 percent of tablets based on pill counts and only 6.8 percent in the intervention group had salicylate levels indicating no recent aspirin use. at the end of the trial median 4.37 years jpad reported 90 percent compliance in the aspirin group.43 at 5 years the prevention of progression of

abnormal abi less than or equal to 0.95 45 individuals with at least one cvd risk factor 59 or those at high risk for ischemic disease based on the northwick park heart study algorithm.54 the lower age limit of inclusion in etdrs was 18 years but it ranged from 30 to 40 years in other trials. hot and jpad specified age 80 and 85 years as upper limits while popadad specified no upper age limit. all studies were intended to target primary prevention candidates and excluded participants with a history of stroke or mi except hot and tpt which only excluded those with an mi coronary event or stroke in the recent past or occurring in the 12 months prior to recruitment. all studies excluded those taking current or regular aspirin therapy as well as those with aspirin contraindications or aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 14 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc allergies. seven of the trials excluded those with a history of peptic ulcer disease 43 44 53 54 57 gi hemorrhage 55 or severe indigestion.45 four trials excluded those with poor survival prognosis.44 55 56 59 in the seven studies that reported mean ages the mean age was relatively young and ranged from 54.6 to 64.5 years.43 45 54 56 58 59 ninety percent of whs participants were younger than 65 years 75 percent of phs participants were younger than 60 years. three trials recruited only men 53 54 57 one trial

cardiovascular events 19 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc current past smokers for total stroke ischemic stroke and a cvd event composite.58 overall no clear relationship between smoking status and aspirin effects was apparent. for cvd risk two trials58 64 performed risk based subanalyses and a third trial was conducted in a high risk cvd population.54 none of these trials clearly reported interaction testing or adjustments for confounders and only one analysis was clearly reported as a priori.58 one trial with subgroup analysis by cvd risk showed that only participants with greater than 20 percent 10 year risk had a statistically significant reduction in total mi and the trial s reported cvd composite 56 one exclusively female trial showed that only participants with a greater than or equal to10 percent 10 year cvd risk had a statistically significant reduction in total stroke.58 the one trial conducted in high risk men showed a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal mi coronary events and in a nonfatal composite cvd outcome.54 the att ipd meta analysis showed a statistically significant reduction in total serious vascular events only in the patients with less than 5 percent 5 year cvd risk but heterogeneity testing revealed no statistical heterogeneity between the risk groups.33 based on two trials recruiting participants with an abnormal abi there appears to be no modification of treatment benefit based on abi threshold.44 45 trials examining the subgroup effects of patients with elevated blood pressure or lipid levels reported conflicting results making it difficult to draw any conclusions about a differential benefit of aspirin in these groups. five trials performed subgroup analyses in hypertensive and normotensive groups or for systolic blood pressure sbp diastolic blood pressure dbp levels with varied results.53 58 64 66 one of these trials hot showed a trend of higher sbp and dbp being associated with a greater reduction in major cardiovascular events and total mi.64 conversely another of these trials reported an interaction with lower sbp leading to a greater rr reduction in total stroke 66 but the timing of their analysis is unclear. further one trial reported no trends in the rr of total mi coronary events or cvd mortality by sbp dbp level.53 as a result the results of these studies were inconsistent. four trials reported subgroup analyses by total cholesterol levels or by presence or absence of dyslipidemia defined as total cholesterol 240 mg dl in whs not defined in jpad .43 53 58 66 while two of these trials performed subgroup analyses a priori 43 58 the other two trials do not specify the timing of their analyses.53 66 two trials were conducted exclusively in men and showed an interaction between aspirin use and lipid levels with greater aspirin benefit seen in patients with the lowest cholesterol levels for total mi coronary events or total stroke.53 66 another trial which was conducted exclusively in women showed a statistically significant reduction in composite cvd outcomes total stroke and ischemic stroke with aspirin therapy which was not seen in the normal cholesterol group.58 age trial characteristics in the seven studies that reported mean ages the mean age was relatively young and ranged from 54.6 to 64.5 years.43 45 54 56 58 59 ninety percent of whs participants were younger than age 65 years and 75 percent of phs participants were younger than age 60 years. in three trials approximately half of participants were older than age 60 to 65 years.43 44 59 the upper age limit was specified in the inclusion criteria for six trials ranging from 69 to 85 years.43 45 53 56 aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 20 kaiser permanente research

age group strata were jpad and hot 65 and 65 years .43 60 the att ipd meta analysis analyzed the composite outcome of serious vascular events defined as mi stroke or death from a vascular cause including sudden death pulmonary embolism and hemorrhage by patients younger than age 65 and patients age 65 years or older.33 results by outcome effect of aspirin on all cause mortality by age only one trial hot reported all cause mortality by age and reported no statistically significant effect of aspirin on all cause mortality in either patients younger than age 65 years or those age 65 years or older table 8 .60 effect of aspirin on mi coronary events by age three trials provided subgroup analyses by age for total mi but only whs had an a priori analysis table 9 .53 58 60 hot and whs both

consistent trend of greater rr reduction in total mi coronary events with aspirin use with older age both phs and whs reported p values for interaction of 0.02 and 0.03 with age.53 58 a 2011 post hoc analysis of whs showed that aspirin treatment resulted in less than 1 percent absolute risk reduction in major cardiovascular events among the majority of patients 90 age was the strongest determinant of treatment effect where older women age 65 years had the highest absolute treatment effects.67 the att ipd meta analysis did not find any heterogeneity of effect on major coronary events by age.33 effect of aspirin on stroke by age three trials provided subgroup analyses by age for total stroke but again only whs clearly specified theirs as an a priori analysis table 10 .54 58 60 none of these

however both trials showed trends of benefit favoring aspirin among younger patients 62 or 65 years and among the older age groups 62 or 65 years favoring control.45 60 further hot showed a

as mi coronary death or sudden death and performed interaction testing and adjustments for multiple comparisons. in 2013 8 years after the completion of whs an observational followup of a median of 18 years comprising 33 682 patients out of the original 39 876 randomized trial participants 88.6 was published using annual participant questionnaires and medical record review.68 these results were

effect vary by dose formulation or duration of aspirin use summary of results trials using aspirin doses of 100 mg day or less achieved a similar and statistically significant reduction in nonfatal mi coronary events mimicking the trend we observed when pooling trials of all doses. additionally when the trials using doses of 100 mg day are pooled a statistically significant reduction in nonfatal

heterogeneity of the trials populations and designs. based on time to event data any cvd related benefit likely begins within the first 5 years of treatment without any consistent data to support that benefit diminishes over time. dose seven trials administered aspirin at a dosage of 100 mg or less daily or every other day 43 45 54 56 58 59 one trial used 325 mg every other day 53 one used 500 mg

pooled studies using doses of less than 325 mg daily for the outcomes of fatal cvd events nonfatal stroke and nonfatal mi coronary events which confirms the primary finding that nonfatal mi coronary events is the only outcome for which there was a statistically significant reduction with aspirin table 17 . for the outcome of all cause mortality despite a similar point estimate results became nonsignificant when we pooled only the trials using doses of less than 325 mg day. we found similar results to our primary analysis using all doses when we pooled only trials using 100 mg or less daily except nonfatal stroke which became statistically significantly beneficial in the aspirin group rr 0.82 95 ci 0.71 to 0.95 i2 0 . again all cause mortality became nonsignificant after pooling only trials using doses of 100 mg or less table 18 . we performed other sensitivity analyses for the outcome of total stroke table 7 . pooling studies with aspirin doses of 100 mg or less daily revealed a statistically significant reduction in total stroke events k 7 rr 0.85 95 ci 0.76 to 0.96 i2 0 that was not apparent when we combined high dose trials k 3 rr 1.19 95 ci 1.00 to 1.42 i2 0 . these results were similar in a sensitivity analysis using the peto or equation. while this may reflect a lower risk of hemorrhagic stroke with lower doses of aspirin hemorrhagic stroke events were rare in the seven trials reporting this outcome table 19 . as such we could not confirm this hypothesis. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 31 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc formulation half of the studies specified tablet formulation two trials used enteric coated45 59 and three trials used other or unspecified formulations.43 44 56 qualitatively there does not appear to be any association between formulation and aspirin effect for any outcome analyzed. duration time to event data were available from eight trials that reported varying conclusions regarding minimum time to benefit and benefit duration with aspirin use for various select outcomes. overall available data suggest that any cvd benefit from aspirin begins within the first 1 to 5 years without a clear upper time limit to benefit due to inconsistent results and relatively short trial durations half of these eight trials had durations of 5 years or less.43 45 54 55 58 60 61 four trials reported

nonfatal ihd curves showing divergence after 1 year.54 whs showed cumulative incidence curves for ischemic and total stroke with statistically significant divergence for ischemic stroke p 0.009 and total stroke p 0.04 starting at approximately 2 years of this 10 year trial while the curves for mi and the primary cvd composite showed no difference in the aspirin and control groups.58 aaa provided

time dependent analysis suggested that the hr for mi benefit with aspirin declined with time however data were not shown for adjusted hrs although this appears to be true for unadjusted rrs reported for mi composite cvd events and total mortality beyond 5 years. the authors postulated that this could aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 32 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc be attributed to declines in adherence over time delay rather than prevention of events or random chance.55 qualitatively stratifying forest plots for our primary outcomes by followup time equivalent to treatment duration in the trials does not appear to suggest an association between treatment duration and aspirin effect. kq 2. does regular aspirin use increase gi bleeding hemorrhagic stroke or other serious harms summary of results the nine rcts addressing the harms of aspirin in primary prevention populations reported harms variably and reported different outcomes. additionally some trials did not define bleeding type or severity and no trial reported ascertainment methods.43 45 53 54 56 59 qualitatively it appears that aspirin was associated with an increased risk of total hemorrhagic stroke in the seven trials reporting this outcome with rrs ranging from 0.68 to 4.01 table 19 . the incidence of this outcome was so rare 0.5 however that precise estimates are not possible. major gi bleeding reported in the seven trials was rare 0.8 and rrs were greater than 1 in all but one trial ranging from 1.13 to 8.10. the att ipd meta analysis showed a 50 percent increase in major gi and

addressed the harms of aspirin in primary prevention populations.43 45 53 54 56 59 these nine trials two good quality and seven fair quality are discussed at length in kq 1. assessing harms in many trials was difficult as they did not define bleeding events or bleeding severity and none of the trials reported ascertainment methods for these bleeding harms although they were presumably gathered by participant questionnaire and or medical records. results by outcome hemorrhagic stroke total hemorrhagic stroke events were far less common than ischemic strokes. seven trials reported this

summary of results bleeding events were rare in all trials making it difficult to draw generalizable conclusions regarding the relationship between aspirin dose duration and formulation and bleeding events. dose in the seven primary prevention trials reporting hemorrhagic stroke or major gi bleeding there appears to be no qualitative association between these outcomes and aspirin dose figures 16 19 table 19 . this result is likely due to such few events being reported four out of seven trials reported 10 events in the aspirin group making the numbers unstable. this is illustrated by bmd which had the highest dose 500 mg day but showed a trend toward reduced major gi bleeding rr 0.5 95 ci 0.10 to 2.47 . again this is likely due to small numbers of events being reported and the point estimate being unstable.57 formulation half of the studies specified tablet formulation two trials used enteric coated formulations45 59 and three trials used other or unspecified formulations.43 44 56 qualitatively there is no apparent association of formulation and aspirin effect for major gi bleeding or hemorrhagic stroke. duration for the 10 trials included in this kq mean trial duration

cardiovascular events 39 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 4. discussion summary table 22 presents a summary of evidence for each kq which we discuss briefly next. our meta analysis of 10 primary prevention trials confirmed the conclusions from several other published meta analyses showing that aspirin reduces the risk of major cvd events total mi total stroke or cvd death by about 11 percent which appears to be largely driven by a 20 percent reduction in nonfatal mi appendix e table 3 .33 72 75 this effect on nonfatal mi coronary events persisted when pooling only trials using aspirin with average daily doses of 100 mg or less. when pooling trials with doses of 100 mg or less a nonfatal stroke benefit emerged as statistically significant. our meta analysis showed a modest statistically significant reduction in all cause mortality which was not persistent in sensitivity analyses of lower dose aspirin 100 mg day . this finding was not reported in other meta analyses.33 72 75 a concurrent review concluded that modest reductions in all cause mortality cannot completely be explained through cvd and or cancer mortality reduction.50 it appears that the nonfatal mi coronary event benefit begins sometime within the first 5 years of use. while we did not pool major gi bleeding events because of study heterogeneity and rarity of events we qualitatively found that most trials supported an increased risk similar to those reported in four prior meta analyses that showed an increase in major bleeding events with statistically significant measures of association ranging from 1.54 to 1.70.33 72 73 75 thus in a primary prevention population the net impacts on cvd prevention are modest and closely matched by increases in major bleeding risks. risk based approach in any given population the benefits of aspirin for primary prevention are directly related to the rr reduction realized from aspirin and the baseline risk of cvd events balanced by the serious harms of gi bleeding and hemorrhagic strokes. to maximize the effectiveness side of the equation we must identify a subpopulation for whom either 1 the rr reduction realized from aspirin is higher than the average population or 2 the baseline risk of cvd events is higher than the average population and high enough to outweigh the serious bleeding risks. our systematic review aimed to critically appraise the subpopulation literature to answer these questions and found that very few a priori subgroup analyses were available even fewer performed interaction testing and none adequately controlled for important confounders. there are four specific subpopulations of greatest interest age sex diabetes and baseline cvd risk. given the few available subgroup analyses we focused on within study comparisons and did not pool data for any individual population subgroups because of few contributing studies small numbers of events trial design and population heterogeneity.76 79 sex for sex our qualitative analysis of the 10 rcts showed no pattern for sex and outcome specific trends in composite cvd events mi coronary events or stroke outcomes except in whs aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 40 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc which was the largest primary prevention population of women studied to date 90 of whom were younger than age 65 years . whs showed that while aspirin reduced ischemic stroke it did not reduce total mi coronary events except in the oldest age group of women 65 years or older where mi coronary events were reduced by 34 percent in the aspirin group compared with the control group rr 0.66 95 ci 0.44 to 0.97 .58 sex specific meta analyses of six of the 10 trials showed conflicting results while one meta analysis showed a sex specific difference with women realizing benefit for total and ischemic stroke and men realizing benefit for reduction in total mi interaction testing and multivariate adjustment for other risk factors were not performed. additionally these findings were predominantly driven by the whs results.61 it is possible that the relatively young age of the whs population together with lack of adjustment for confounders including age led to a sex and outcome specific conclusion in this meta analysis.61 the att ipd meta analysis of the same six trials showed that after controlling for multiple comparisons the apparent sex specific differences in mi coronary events and ischemic stroke events were no longer statistically significant.33 subsequent to the att publication other meta analyses have confirmed the findings of no sex specific outcome specific differences in major cvd events.75 furthermore the lack of heterogeneity of treatment effect in the secondary aspirin prevention literature puts such sex specific findings in question.33 appendix e table 4 provides a timeline of publications to illustrate the changing findings for sex specific conclusions about aspirin for cvd prevention. diabetes from six trials with evidence on patients with diabetes our qualitative synthesis found no effect modification based on diabetes status for any of our cvd related outcomes. this confirms the findings from five prior systematic reviews that pooled three to six trials in populations or subpopulations with diabetes and showed no statistically significant reduction in cvd events total mi or total stroke 80 84 as well as a large swedish observational study showing no cvd event cvd mortality or all cause mortality benefit among diabetes patients.85 the suggested biologic plausibility of a lack of effect of aspirin in patients with diabetes could be based on aspirin resistance and possibly increased platelet turnover.86 87 patients with diabetes are at a two to four fold risk for cvd events compared to those without diabetes 11 13 however evidence suggests that is not a chd risk equivalent since diabetes patients have a 43 percent lower risk of chd events compared with those with a known history of chd events.88 some have suggested that the use of aspirin in diabetes therefore lies somewhere between primary and secondary prevention. results from two european cohorts further complicate the discussion of aspirin s net benefit for diabetes patients. one of these studies an italian population based cohort using administrative data from more than 4 million individuals showed that diabetes patients have an increased risk of major bleeding compared to those without diabetes regardless of aspirin use. this study did show however that aspirin use only marginally increases major bleeding rates in patients with diabetes compared to nonaspirin users with diabetes.89 the other study a swedish patient registry of 58 465 individuals showed that aspirin use was associated with increased all cause mortality in diabetes patients without cvd particularly among older patients after controlling for confounders.90 both of these cohort studies have the major limitations of being administrative database analyses which are particularly prone to erroneous conclusions of causality. two large in progress rcts enrolling more than 20 000 patients with diabetes may definitively answer this question regarding whether or not aspirin is effective for primary aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 41 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc prevention in this population a study of cardiovascular events in diabetes ascend 91 and aspirin and simvastatin combination for cardiovascular events prevention trial in diabetes accept d .92 age older adults were the only subpopulation for which there appears to be a differential benefit from aspirin. studies consistently showed a greater rr reduction in total mi coronary events among older age groups based on three trials 53 58 60 with whs and hot showing a statistically significant one third reduction in total mi coronary events for those age 65 years or older. likewise phs showed similar reductions at age 50 years and older. both phs and whs reported statistically significant p values for heterogeneity of treatment effect for age for total mi coronary events and this statistic was not reported for hot. this trend was not seen in the att ipd meta analysis however as this trial did not find any heterogeneity of composite cvd events or coronary events based on age 65 years compared to 65 years .33 concerns about a greater absolute bleeding risk with increasing age regardless of aspirin use 93 makes it important to quantify the rr reduction and balance it with higher bleeding risk. this is especially important for this subpopulation as it appears that each decade of age confers a 50 percent increase in hemorrhagic stroke risk and doubles the risk of major extracranial bleeding.33 the ongoing aspirin in reducing events in the elderly aspree trial has recruited 19 000 men and women age 70 years or older and randomized them to aspirin 100 mg daily versus placebo with a primary outcome of all cause mortality dementia incidence or physical disability and will hopefully provide more precise estimates of harms and benefits in the older adult population.94 cvd risk approach given the lack of apparent treatment effectiveness modification based on individual risk characteristics many international guideline panels have proposed a multiple risk factor based approach. this approach uses a 10 year cvd risk calculator to identify a group with high risk for cvd events thereby maximizing the absolute net benefits from aspirin.95 comparisons of international guidelines reveal that there is wide variation in the risk threshold for aspirin primary prevention recommendations ranging from 4 to 30 percent 10 year chd or cvd risk with several panels recommending against aspirin use for primary prevention regardless of cvd risk category appendix e table 1 . the previous uspstf recommendation recommended aspirin 75 mg day for various 10 year chd or stroke risk thresholds based on age and sex. the u.s. food and drug administration fda recently denied primary prevention of mi as an indication for aspirin in any risk group. this decision was based on a review of six primary prevention trials study level and ipd meta analyses and newer trials in special populations from which the fda concluded there was insufficient evidence to support this indication.96 in the rationale for its decision the fda stated that pooled results are generally not a basis for reaching effectiveness conclusions and furthermore that primary endpoints are given the greatest weight in interpreting evidence in the case of aspirin for primary prevention no study achieved statistically significant results for its planned primary endpoint as interpreted by fda statistical aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 42 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc reviewers.96 clinical guideline implementation requires selection of a specific risk prediction tool. available risk prediction tools vary widely across a number of domains including the definition of chd or cvd outcomes predicted risk factors included and variation in the baseline risk and other characteristics of model derivation cohorts appendix a appendix e table 5 . limitations of risk equations include nonrepresentative or historically dated populations limited ethnic diversity in derivation populations narrowly defined endpoints endpoints influenced by provider preferences endpoints with poor reliability and inclusion or exclusion of novel risk factors.14 19 97 in november 2013 the acc aha guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk was released. this guideline included a new pooled cohort equation for predicting 10 year risk of a first hard atherosclerotic cvd event defined as nonfatal mi chd death and fatal or nonfatal stroke.14 the derivation population included participants from four national heart lung and blood institute sponsored community based cohort studies atherosclerosis risk in communities aric cardiovascular health study chs coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia and framingham framingham offspring and this tool represented a departure from the previous narrower outcome focus of risk assessment for chd.15 additionally while the inclusion of multiethnic populations in the derivation cohorts enabled race and sex specific equations for blacks and whites this was not the case for hispanics asians and other ethnic subpopulations.14 critics have voiced several concerns about the model s calibration citing overprediction that was most notable in the highest risk group of greater than or equal to 10 percent 10 year risk. they also point out the model s discrimination has been summarized as moderate at best using c statistics.14 98 100 in an unpublished in process analysis external validations of the acc aha pooled cohort equation were performed for hispanic men and women in the multiethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa cohort and the antihypertensive and lipid lowering treatment to prevent heart attack allhat trial. preliminary results of this analysis appear to be consistent with other studies that have suggested overprediction in populations other than non hispanic caucasians k. shum personal communication 2014 .14 other externally validated u.s. based models include chd calculators based on framingham data by anderson wilson and atp iii.8 15 16 25 systematic reviews show that external validations of the anderson and wilson models have generally found that they overestimate risk in groups with low observed risk and underpredict risk in groups with higher risk.101 102 evidence from direct comparisons of risk assessment tools suggests potentially small differences in performance across models 100 103 while others have argued that it is not appropriate to compare models head to head because of wide variation in outcome definitions years of followup and absolute risk categories.104 despite the aforementioned shortcomings the acc aha pooled cohort calculator is to date the only u.s. based cvd calculator that has published its external validations in other u.s. based populations. ideally one could develop a model to apply the risk prediction equation for clinical care that would guide shared decisionmaking with patients regarding the risks and benefits of aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 43 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc aspirin. currently a contemporaneous ahrq commissioned model hoping to address these needs is under development.105 harms our qualitative analysis which was limited to major gi bleeding as defined by transfusion hospitalization or death showed an increase in bleeding risk although given trial heterogeneity we were unable to estimate the effect with any precision trials reported rrs between 0.50 and 8.10. other published meta analyses showed major bleeding ors rrs in the primary prevention trials ranging from 1.54 to 1.70.33 72 73 75 given the rarity of hemorrhagic strokes we were unable to precisely estimate this harm in aspirin users. based on the emergence of a total stroke benefit with lower doses of aspirin however it is plausible that some of the hemorrhagic strokes caused by aspirin can be mitigated by lowering the dose. an association with aspirin use and armd has been reported in one large u.s. based cohort study106 and one cross sectional european study107 of nonprimary prevention populations. this association however was not reported by our two included trials reporting this outcome.53 58 cotreatment with statins or ppis experts have suggested that additional considerations should inform aspirin treatment in patients taking other medications such as statins and ppis. while none of our 10 trials reported outcomes in statin users compared with nonusers authoritative evidence shows that statins provide a 25 percent reduction in major vascular events in primary prevention populations.108 it is not clear whether the modest absolute benefit of aspirin seen in the primary prevention population would be further enhanced by concomitant use of statins but there is an in progress trial assessing this issue in populations with diabetes.92 until these results are published it remains unclear how statins may modify aspirin associated benefits or bleeding events.89 our systematic review did not identify any eligible rcts to address whether ppis modify cvd effects with aspirin or bleeding risk in primary prevention populations. co administration of ppis with low dose aspirin to mitigate associated bleeding risks is being primarily pursued in those with indications for aspirin treatment i.e. postcvd procedure or secondary prevention . for primary prevention populations without disease trials of ppi low dose aspirin would be needed to determine the net effect including whether the primary prevention aims are affected by this additional medication. limitations of the literature there are several limitations of the literature. the 10 primary prevention studies are heterogeneous in terms of aspirin dose duration of therapy baseline population characteristics comorbid conditions and most importantly baseline cvd risk at trial entry. additionally trials were powered for composite outcomes combining fatal and nonfatal events of varying aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 44 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc severity 109 where individual outcomes of mi and stroke were rare enough in this primary prevention population to make any findings of nonstatistical significance potentially due to lack of power. we were unable to draw any conclusions regarding formulation specifically whether or not enteric coated aspirin has diminished gi bleeding risks. because of the relatively short trial durations and lack of comparable time to event data reporting in the trials we could not precisely determine the minimum time to benefit other than to conclude that the cvd related benefits i.e. nonfatal mi occur during the first 5 years of therapy. as such it remains unclear whether the nonfatal mi benefit continues to accrue at a constant rate beyond 5 to 10 years of use. followup in most studies was 4 to 6 years although only one trial provided extended observational followup at 18 years.67 as a result we cannot exclude larger benefits conferred over a longer time period in a primary prevention population. while we found that ideal dosing for primary prevention is likely 100 mg per day or less it is unclear if every other day dosing versus daily dosing makes a difference for cvd benefits. additionally some literature suggests that every other day dosing may not be sufficient for other types of aspirin benefit i.e. cancer benefits .110 at this point there is scant data to support any effect modification in any population. subgroup analyses rarely reported interaction testing never adequately controlled for confounders and commonly did not specify timing of subgroup analyses lending it to bias.110 111 bleeding outcomes were variably reported and given the general underreporting of harms112 and the restrictive inclusion criteria in rcts these trials likely underestimate bleeding risks in real practice. limitations of our review we limited our review to english language primary prevention literature for both effectiveness and harms therefore we only examined a subset of the harms literature. moreover we limited our review of bleeding to major gi bleeding defined as requiring transfusion or hospitalization or leading to death bleeding of lesser severity and trials that did not specify bleeding severity were not addressed. we did not examine other potential noncvd benefits from aspirin i.e. cancer benefits . two contemporaneous ahrq commissioned systematic reviews however are addressing all of these issues.50 113 conclusions and future research needs nearly half of the primary prevention trials recruited patients in the 1980s and most trials reflect usual clinical care administered more than 20 years ago. aspirin s potential role in primary prevention will continue to evolve based on the magnitude of a modest relative benefit balanced with bleeding risks in the context of declining smoking rates increasing statin use and more aggressive hypertension management. recent trials44 45 43 published since the last review for the uspstf35 focus on special populations for whom absolute risk reduction could outweigh bleeding harms however these trials failed to show any cvd benefit even for the composite outcomes they were powered to detect. nonetheless we identified this question about aspirin s benefit in subpopulations as the area with the greatest evidence gaps. there remains a role for future research to identify subpopulations who may realize a clinically important net benefit from aspirin. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular events 45 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc we identified the following research gaps concomitant therapy with statins or ppis rct level data are needed that examine the absolute benefit of aspirin with concurrent statin use in those deemed at elevated cvd risk. these data could further elucidate the nature of the effect of aspirin and statins combined in primary prevention populations but it is crucial that these trials are sufficiently powered to assess hard cvd outcomes with long term followup 10 years . this research could also determine whether there are populations at high enough risk to realize a moderate benefit from aspirin use in primary prevention. similarly the impact of co therapy with ppis on the net effect of low dose aspirin in primary prevention populations would inform this potential approach. subpopulations with diabetes diabetes patients are an important subpopulation that needs further study. the pending ascend and accept d trials could provide evidence for a role for aspirin in primary prevention for any subpopulations with diabetes. racial ethnic subpopulations to date there is no data available or in process rcts addressing the role of aspirin used for primary prevention in racial ethnic subpopulations trials are needed to inform current practice. ipd meta analyses ipd meta analyses provide important data that complement existing trial data. an updated ipd meta analysis that includes the three new trials published since the att ipd meta analysis33 and adjusts for confounders is needed to fully evaluate aspirin s effect in important subpopulations. aspirin to prevent cardiovascular

authors conclusions based on findings from whs and the berger 2006 meta analysis aspirin reduces the risk of cvd events in men and women without a history of cvd. men have reduced risk for mi and

adjustment for other risk factors was not performed. authors conclusions in primary prevention aspirin is of uncertain net value as the reduction in occlusive events needs to be weighed against an increase in major bleeds. uspstf response to the att collaboration meta analysis 2009136 uspstf website may 30 2009 the task force responded that combining data on men and women obscures gender specific benefits noting that a gender specific analysis is most appropriate in this case given the differing epidemiology of cardiovascular disease in men and women. the task force cited the heterogeneity of treatment effect suggesting that a gender combined analysis is not appropriate for drawing an overall conclusion. the task force also noted that the att authors use of a combined outcome of serious vascular event defined as myocardial infarction mi stroke or death from a vascular cause including sudden death pulmonary embolism and hemorrhage further obscures interpretation of findings since it combines widely varying entities across a wide spectrum of severity. such a combined outcome diluted the observed effects of the reduction of mis in men and reduction of stroke in women. finally the uspstf disagreed with the suitability of subgroup analysis by chd risk because chd risk stratification would not capture the potential benefit of reduction in stroke in women.

increased markedly since the previous american heart association statement on exercise risk. on the other hand vigorous physical activity particularly when performed by unfit individuals can acutely increase the risk of sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction in susceptible people. recent studies have also shown that large exercise volumes and vigorous intensities are both associated with potential cardiac maladaptations including accelerated coronary artery calcification exercise induced cardiac biomarker release myocardial fibrosis and atrial fibrillation. the relationship between these maladaptive responses and physical activity often forms a u or reverse j shaped dose response curve. this scientific statement discusses the cardiovascular and health implications for moderate to vigorous physical activity as well as high volume high intensity exercise regimens based on current understanding of the associated risks and benefits. the goal is to provide healthcare professionals with updated information to advise patients on appropriate preparticipation screening and the benefits and risks of physical activity or physical exertion in varied environments and during competitive events. key words aha scientific statements cardiorespiratory fitness exercise high intensity interval training j shaped curve physical exertion risk assessment risk of exercise d

movement resulting from the contraction of skeletal muscle that increases energy expenditure above the basal level. a systematic review and meta analysis of 33 pa studies n 883 372 participants reported risk reductions of 30 to 50 for cardiovascular mortality and 20 to 50 for all cause mortality with increas ing volumes of pa.4 more recently researchers from the nurses health study n 78 865 and the health pro fessionals follow up study n 44 354 estimated the impact of 5 lifestyle factors including 30 min d of moderate to vigorous pa on life expectancy in the us population.5 during up to 34 years of follow up the most physically active cohorts of men and women dem onstrated 7 to 8 year gains in life expectancy. exercise training as a subcategory of pa is defined as any planned and structured intervention with the objec tive of improving or maintaining crf or health achiev ing athletic goals or both. aerobic capacity or crf can be directly measured during cardiopulmonary exercise testing via gas exchange measurements or estimated from the attained treadmill speed percent grade and duration minutes or the cycle ergometer workload expressed as kilogram meters per minute. after a 12 week exercise based cardiac rehabilitation program in a cohort of 5600 patients with known cvd each 1 met abolic equivalent met 1 met 3.5 ml o 2 kg 1 min 1 improvement in estimated crf crfe was associated with a 13 overall reduced risk of all cause mortality and in the least fit patient cohort 5 met capacity a 30 reduction in mortality.6 these risk reductions compare favorably with the survival benefit conferred by commonly prescribed cardioprotective medications including statins.7 in us veterans the incidence of major cvd events was 16 lower for every 1 met increase in crfe. compared with the least fit veterans the risk of cvd events was 70 lower for individuals in the highest fitness category.8 a prospective cohort study of 120 000 consecutive patients who underwent maximal treadmill testing and 1.1 million person years of observation reported no upper limit for the protec tive effect of higher crfe on all cause mortality. com pared with the lowest performers 25th percentile elite crfe 97.7th percentile was associated with an 80 reduction in mortality risk. remarkably the effect of low crfe on all cause mortality was comparable to or greater than that of traditional risk factors such as smoking and diabetes mellitus for coronary artery dis ease cad .9 a study from the uk biobank n 502 635 showed inverse associations between crfe and chd hazard ratio hr 0.51 95 ci 0.38 0.69 and crfe and atrial fibrillation af hr 0.40 95 ci 0.30 0.55 among individuals at high genetic risk for these diseas es.10 others have reported that highly fit individuals re gardless of their risk factor profile have an 50 lower 30 year cvd mortality than their counterparts with low fitness.11 similarly men with subclinical cad coronary artery calcium cac score 100 whose crfe was 10 mets have an age adjusted hr for chd events of 0.26 95 ci 0.15 0.45 compared with men whose crfe is 10 mets.12 more recently compared with the least fit men cvd events were shown to be progressively re duced with increasing fitness levels and the effect was more prominent in individuals with the highest levels of cac.13 collectively these epidemiological analyses combined with evidence of biological plausibility fig ure 1 14 15 support a cause and effect relationship be tween increased levels of pa and crf and reduced cvd mortality16 18 and suggest that being unfit is an indepen dent risk factor for chd figure 2 .1 19 higher levels of pa or crf 5 mets before hospi talization for acute coronary syndromes acs and sur gical procedures are associated with better short term outcomes 20 21 possibly because of exercise induced ischemic preconditioning.22 an investigation of 2172 patients hospitalized for acs evaluated the effect of preadmission pa on in hospital and 1 month post discharge cvd health outcomes.23 patients were cat egorized as physically inactive reference category minimally active and highly active. multivariate analysis revealed that compared with the inactive cohort mini mal or high activity was associated with a 44 95 ci 10 68 reduction of in hospital mortality and a 20 95 ci 1 50 lower risk of a cvd event within the first month of hospital discharge.23 compli cations after elective or emergent surgical procedures including bariatric surgery24 and coronary artery bypass grafting 25 are also increased in those with reduced pre operative levels of pa or crf figure 3 .26 the favorable risk factor profiles and superior car diac performance of long distance runners and the ob servation that vigorous pa and high levels of crf are associated with reduced use of diabetic hypertensive and hypercholesterolemia medications27 suggest that high volume and high intensity endurance training reg imens including high intensity interval training hiit 28 are cardioprotective in individuals with and without chd. these data have likely contributed to increasing numbers of middle aged and older adults concluding that more exercise is better. 29 as a result worldwide participation in half and full marathon races triath lon events and hiit has increased markedly since the american heart association s aha s previous state

these studies suggest that high volume high intensity training regimens may at least in some individuals create a substrate for adverse cardiovascu lar adaptations and the potential for exercise related acute cardiac events.37 although vigorous pa usually defined as 60 functional capacity appears to be superior to mod erate intensity exercise 40 59 functional capac ity in eliciting cardiovascular adaptations and better outcomes 28 38 including crf 39 even if the total ener gy expenditure is held constant 40 the relative risk of acute cardiovascular events increases during vigorous to high intensity pa compared with the risk at other times.41 this is particularly true among habitually seden tary individuals with known or occult cvd performing unaccustomed strenuous pa.41 although an absolute exercise intensity 6 mets has been suggested as vigor ous pa in some population based applications it does not account for the fact that the cardiac demand of any pa is determined not by the specific metabolic level but by the metabolic demand relative to the individual s functional capacity. consequently lower met require ments can still place considerable stress on the cardio vascular system of unfit older individuals and those with established cvd.30 in people with a diseased or susceptible heart there is the potential for a plateau or even a decline in ben

because more people are engaged in this activity.42 this scientific statement seeks to update the benefits and risks of exercise based on current understanding of exercise related scd conditions that

risks of moderate to vigorous pa. cardiovascular risks of exercise most studies 43 46 but not all 47 48 have reported a de crease in cardiovascular events with increasing regular pa. despite these long term benefits the risk of scd and myocardial infarction mi is increased during and shortly after bouts of vigorous physical exertion. the relationship between physical exertion and scd has been widely studied both in general popula tions and in athletes. the proportion of scds related to physical exertion in the general population varies widely 43 45 48 54 from 3 45 to 26 53 depending on age sex and ethnic racial characteristics of the population. the proportion of scds that occur during physical ex ertion is higher in younger age groups.53 54 in a recent community wide study sports related sudden cardiac arrest sca accounted for 39 of scas in individuals 18 years old 13 in those between 19 and 25 years old and 7 between the ages of 25 and 34.53 the pro portion of deaths that occur during physical exertion in competitive athletes 35 years of age is much higher than in nonathletes in the general population.53 in the most recent registries from the united states55 and the united kingdom 56 61 to 80 of the scds in ath letes occurred during or just after physical exertion. al though the incidence of scds related to acute exertion is higher in competitive athletes the absolute numbers of scds are greater during recreational sports 51 and most of these exertion related scd events occurred in adults 35 years of age.51 however even in younger age groups the majority of exercise related cardiac arrests occur in those not engaged in organized com petitive sports.57 58 therefore despite the high profile of sports related scd the majority of exercise related scds occur during recreational exercise. acute mi ami also occurs with a higher than ex pected frequency during or soon after physical exer tion. scd and ami overlap among men 30 years of age in whom exertion related scds are often associ ated with underlying chd or acute plaque rupture.59 the proportion of amis associated with exertion ranges from 4.4 41 to 13.6 .41 60 63 exercise is also a trigger for acute type a aortic dissection which has been re ported in alpine skiers64 and weight lifters.65 66 sudden death caused by aortic dissection or rupture of an aor tic aneurysm is found on autopsy in only 2 to 3 of scds in athletes51 57 67 and 4 of exertion related scds in broader populations.58 the relative versus ab solute risks of exercise and pa are summarized below. short term relative risks several studies have estimated the relative risk rr of scd and mi during and up to 1 hour after exercise using case crossover and case control study designs. these studies have consistently reported that the rr of scd or mi is transiently elevated during and immediate ly after physical exertion compared with other activities or rest but the magnitude of the short term rr varied across studies.41 43 45 48 60 63 sudden cardiac death several studies of differing designs primarily of men have estimated the rr of sca and scd during vigor ous exertion compared with rest or more moderate pa.43 48 68 69 in a prospective case crossover analysis of men in the us physician s health study the risk of scd was transiently elevated 17 fold in the period during and up to 30 minutes after vigorous exertion.48 on the other hand only a 3 fold increase in risk was reported during and up to an hour after vigorous exercise in a retrospective case crossover study involving men and women from slovenia.68 in all studies regular participa tion in vigorous exercise decreased the magnitude of the increased scd risk associated with vigorous exer tion 43 48 68 such that the highest risks were observed in the least active individuals. men with the lowest level of habitual pa had marked elevations in the short term figure 3. possible impact of decreased preoperative

of scd remained elevated during exertion even among the most habitually active men.43 48 there are limited data regarding whether more mod erate levels of exercise might trigger scd. one prospec tive case crossover study among middle aged nurses reported the rr of scd associated with combined expo sure to both moderate and vigorous levels of exertion.45 because of the small number of exercise associated scds in women the risk of moderate versus vigorous exercise could not be analyzed separately. the rr of scd was modestly but significantly elevated during and 30 minutes after moderate and vigorous exercise with an estimated rr of 2.4 95 ci 1.2 4.6 p 0.01 . this transient increase in risk was again reduced by regular exercise participation with the highest risks observed among women who reported 2 hours per week of moderate to vigorous exertion rr 9.0 95 ci 3.3 24.3 . in contrast to prior studies that examined vigor ous exercise in men 43 48 this transient elevation in risk was no longer significant among the most habitually active women. women who reported participating in moderate to vigorous exercise 2 hours per week had an rr of 1.5 95 ci 0.61 3.61 . myocardial infarction several studies using differing designs have also dem onstrated significant 2 to 10 fold elevations in the like lihood of experiencing an ami within 1 hour of par ticipating in vigorous exertion 41 60 63 70 71 with 1 study demonstrating risk elevations persisting to 2 hours.62 when the available data from 7 studies n 5503 pa tients were combined using meta analysis the summa ry rr of mi associated with bouts of physical exertion was 3.45 95 ci 2.33 5.13 with substantial be tween study heterogeneity that was not explained by study size or the year the study was conducted.72 effect sizes for the association of episodic pa did not appear to change significantly over time. again as is the case for scd the magnitude of association between pa as a trigger of mi was greater in individuals with the low est habitual activity. in these 7 studies estimates of the rr associated with a bout of vigorous exertion in the least habitually active individuals ranged from 4.571 to 10741 for mi. in comparison rr estimates of mi in the setting of exertion were much more modest 0.88 3.3 in those with the highest levels of habitual pa.72 in a meta regression analysis the rr of mi associated with episodic pa was decreased by 45 for each additional time per week a person habitually exercised.72 since this meta analysis was published in 2011 the interheart study has reported results from a retro spective case crossover design performed in the larg est population to date including 12 461 patients with first mi in 262 centers across 52 countries.63 participa tion in heavy physical exertion was reported by 13.6 of participants within the 1 hour before mi compared with 9.1 at the same hour on a previous day control period . compared with the control period the adjust ed rr of ami within 1 hour of physical exertion was estimated to be 2.3 95 ci 2.0 2.7 correspond ing to a population attributable risk of 7.7 95 ci 6.3 8.8 . unlike prior studies this study did not demonstrate evidence of effect modification by base line pa level. however the latter analysis only stratified by overall participation in categories of pa by intensity sedentary mild moderate or strenuous and not by frequency of participation. compared with vigorous exercise the data on whether moderate exercise also acutely elevates the risk of mi are much more limited. one case crossover study within the myocardial infarction registry in augs burg germany reported a modest increase in the risk of mi within 2 hours of participation in moderate exer tion mets 5 rr 1.6 95 ci 1.2 2.1 .71 however a prior study from the same region in germany found no elevation in the risk of mi associated with moder ate physical exertion.60 both studies demonstrated no association between lighter levels of exertion and ami. absolute risks although there is a heightened rr of acute cardiac events with unaccustomed vigorous pa it is important to recognize that the absolute risk of experiencing scd or mi during physical exertion is very small. for example in the physicians health study marked elevations in the rr of scd during and after a bout of vigorous physical exertion translated into an absolute risk of only 1 scd for every 1.51 million episodes.48 this absolute risk is even lower in middle aged women among whom 1 scd oc curred for every 36.5 million person hours of participa tion in moderate to vigorous exercise.45 retrospective multicenter data from fitness facilities also report low absolute rates of adverse cvd events 1 per 1 124 200 and 1 per 887 526 person hours for nonfatal and fatal cardiovascular events respectively.73 in patients with es tablished heart disease in supervised cardiac rehabilita tion facilities the absolute cvd event rate is higher 1 event per 58 000 patient hours but still low.74 given that even the most avid exercisers do not spend the majority of their time exercising these low absolute risks translate into extremely low incident rates of exertion related scd in the general population. re ported annual incidence rates of exertion related scd in the population at large and across various subgroups are shown in table 1. population based estimates

non exercise related out of hospital cardiac arrest 46.2 versus 17.2 . although rates of exertion re lated sca are somewhat lower in japan the overall in cidence rate of exercise related out of hospital cardiac arrest increased from 0.18 to 0.43 per 100 000 person years from 2005 to 2012.75 a population based study in oregon of adults 35 to 65 years of age found a simi lar estimate of sports related sca as in the netherland s population 2.1 per 100 000 person years .50 to place these absolute rates of sports related sca into perspec tive the absolute rate of sca in other settings is much higher because of the greater absolute time spent in sedentary activities. in the oregon and japan studies the absolute incidence of nonsports sca was estimated to be 55.5 and 43.5 per 100 000 person years respec tively.50 75 fewer estimates exist for exercise associated mi but a swedish population based study suggested that the absolute incidence of exercise associated mi was 0.75 per 100 000 person years.70 impact of age and sex on exertion related cvd risk impact of age few data are available as to whether age modifies the rr of scd during exertion however according to a population based study from germany older individu als had a higher rr of mi during and after exertion.71 in contrast the larger interheart study did not find higher rrs of mi in older individuals.63 the absolute in cidence of exertion related scd and mi increases over 35 years of age 51 70 with the greatest numbers of exer tion related scds reported between 40 and 64 years of age.51 in the netherlands the incidence of exercise related sca was 10 fold higher in individuals 35 years old 3.0 per 100 000 person years than among those 35 years old 0.3 per 100 000 person years .49 in france the absolute incidence of sports associated scd increased with age in men but not women. the abso lute risk in men ranged from 0.4 per year per 100 000 in those 15 to 24 years of age to 17.5 per 100 000 in those 55 to 64 years of age.76 absolute risks in athletes although incidence rates of exertion related scd are lower in younger age groups rates of exercise associ ated scd or sca are 4.5 fold higher in competitive athletes than in recreational athletes of similar age 10 35 years old .51 highly fit competitive athletes spend a significant proportion of time in both training and com petition and the intensity of exercise is likely greater both of which could contribute to the higher incidence of exercise related acute cardiac events. in france the incidence rate was estimated at 0.9 per 100 000 per year in young competitive athletes compared with 0.2 per 100 000 among young noncompetitive athletes.51 in series from the united states and the veneto region of italy estimates of sports related scd were slightly lower at 0.61 per 100 000 person years55 and 0.4 per 100 000 person years 77 respectively. although the inci dence rates of exertion related scd are proportionally higher in competitive athletes most exertion related scds in those 35 years of age occur in noncompeti tive sports participants primarily because of the larger size of the source population.57 impact of sex the incidence of exertion related scd is much lower in women than men. in multiple populations the risk of scd in association with exercise is 15 to 20 fold higher in men.49 50 76 this sex difference in exercise risk is much more pronounced than the baseline 2 to 3 fold higher overall incidence of scd observed in men ver sus women in epidemiological studies not focusing on exercise alone.49 51 the estimated incidence of sports related scd in women ranges from 0.04 to 0.3 per 100 000 person years compared with 0.5 to 5.8 per 100 000 person years in men.49 76 the sex difference in the incidence of sports related scd is most marked in the 45 to 55 year old age range in which the rr for women has been estimated to be only 3 95 ci 1.5 7.5 of that in similarly aged men.76 sex differ ences in participation in vigorous athletic activity might contribute to part of the lower incidence of exertion related scd among women but likely not all. indeed rates of exertion related scd are higher among male than female college athletes78 and adult athletes par ticipating in the same sporting activity.79 80 for example the incidence of sca during full and half marathons is higher in men than in women 0.9 versus 0.16 per table 1. estimated annual incidence rates of exertion or sports related scd according to population subgroups study population estimated annual incidence rates of exertion

coronary anomalies arrhythmogenic right ventric ular cardiomyopathy arvc and long qt syndrome lqts predominating in women.67 the absolute incidence of exercise associated ami is also slightly higher in men versus women 0.046 ver sus 0.015 per 100 000 person hours respectively but the magnitude of the sex difference is smaller 61 and the majority of studies have not found a sex differ ence in the rr of mi during physical exertion.41 70 71 a study of 1048 patients with ami referred for primary angiography found that men had a higher rr of expe riencing ami during physical exertion and that these men were more likely to be classified as having very low or low levels of habitual pa.61 increasing amounts of regular moderate pa have generally been associated with decreased rates of cvd events in women 45 46 81 but a recent prospective study of 1 million women in the united kingdom raised the possibility that the re lationship might not be similar for vigorous exercise.82 in this study women reporting daily strenuous pa were at higher risk of chd cerebrovascular disease and ve nous thromboembolism than women reporting strenu ous pa 2 to 3 times per week.82 impact of known chd although chd is responsible for a significant pro portion of sports related scd in adults 50 individuals experiencing scd during exercise are less likely to have known heart disease than those who experience scd during other activities. in oregon only 15 of those 35 to 65 years old who experienced sca dur ing sports were known to have heart disease com pared with 30 who experienced sca during other activities or at rest.50 in france only 7 of women had a history of heart disease or 1 cardiovascular risk factor before their sports related scd.51 similarly the majority of exercise associated amis occur in patients without a prior history of chd or ami.41 60 although the incidence of exercise induced cvd events appears to be somewhat higher in patients with established cvd paradoxically the risk of ami during exertion has been reported to be higher in patients without established angina or chd in some41 60 71 but not all studies.63 overall increasing habitual pa is not associ ated with elevated risks of ami or stroke and appears to confer lower total cvd and non cvd mortality in patients with stable chd.83 because epidemiological studies indicate that low crfe in middle age is the strongest predictor of future heart failure with a pre served ejection fraction 84 85 exercise training could be helpful in attenuating or reversing this condition by preventing the associated increase in left ventricular stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.86 exercise related cervical arterial dissection cervical artery dissection which can occur in the ex tracranial carotid or vertebral arteries is an important cause of stroke in young patients87 91 and can result in significant morbidity and mortality.87 92 the multicenter cervical artery dissection and ischemic stroke patients study group found that cervical trauma during sports was more common in stroke patients with cervical artery dissection than in age sex and country matched con trol participants with stroke not associated with arterial dissection.93 although the available evidence supports an association between sports exercise and cervical artery dissection few data are available regarding preventive strategies for patients who participate in sporting activi ties. nevertheless clinicians should be aware of the po tential risk and presenting symptoms of exercise related cervical artery dissections so that patients can be referred for appropriate diagnostic imaging and treatment. common activities associated with acute cardiac events few systematic studies have identified activities associat ed with a heightened rr of cardiac events. this is likely because of the rarity of such events and the difficulty in comparing activities with different and unknown partici pation rates as well as different participant character istics. the cardiovascular stress of vigorous pa is deter mined by the individual s crf because identical physical tasks evoke lower cardiac demands in fit compared with unfit subjects.30 moreover for individuals who already exercise vigorously the more frequently vigorous ex ercise is performed the lower the rr of each exercise bout figure 4 .41 94 additional modulators of so called high risk activities include superimposed physical cogni tive and environmental stresses as well as competition all of which can accentuate the cardiorespiratory and hemodynamic responses and thus heighten the risk of exertion related acute cardiovascular events. strenuous pa especially when sudden unaccus tomed or involving high levels of anaerobic metabo lism increases the risk for ami and scd. for example racquet sports 95 downhill skiing 96 marathon running 80 triathlon participation 79 and high intensity sports activ ities eg basketball 97 may be associated with a greater incidence of acute cardiovascular events than other activities. for certain individuals predominantly men mountaineering activities including mountain hiking and cross country or downhill skiing are associated with a heightened risk of scd.98 at risk individuals are generally characterized by multiple risk factors espe cially older age and in particular patients with heart failure or prior mi with left ventricular dysfunction ejec tion fraction 40 are at greatest risk for scd.99 100 d ow nloaded from http ahajournals.org by on n ovem ber 17 2020 march 31 2020

events are included 1 cardiac event including acs per 957 000 mountain hours . unusual physical exer tion on the first day at altitude acute hypoxia or both may represent the most potent triggers.98 however this risk can be reduced markedly by 5 fold by spending at least 1 night acclimatizing at altitudes above 1300 m before attempting strenuous exertion in the moun tains.101 in addition the excitement of competition may increase sympathetic activity and catecholamine levels and lower the threshold for ventricular fibrillation.102 other activities that are associated with excessive car diac demands and a greater incidence of acute cardio vascular events include deer hunting103 and snow re moval.104 105 snow shoveling has repeatedly been associated with increased cardiovascular events soon after major snow storms 105 107 probably because it can elicit higher rate pressure products than maximal treadmill testing108 and is often performed by unfit individuals with known or oc cult cad. also some cardiac patients develop angina at lower rate pressure products during exercise in cold tem peratures 109 possibly because of cold induced vasospasm. ventricular arrhythmias coronary plaque rupture and st segment elevation mi 110 and subacute stent thrombo sis111 have also been reported with snow shoveling. cardiovascular risk of marathon running and triathlon participation cardiac events during amateur athletic events attract media attention and generate concern about the risks of such activity. to address this concern the racer study race associated cardiac arrest event registry estimated the risk of sca for marathon and half mar athon races among 10.9 million individuals participat ing in us marathons from january 1 2000 to may 31 2010.80 there were 59 cases of sca in individuals 42 13 years of age including 51 men and 42 71 were fatal yielding an sca incidence rate of 0.39 per 100 000 participants. the rate was higher among men than women 0.90 versus 0.16 per 100 000 and among full marathon versus half marathon participants 1.01 versus 0.27 per 100 000 . this corresponds to 1 sca and 1 death per 184 000 and 259 000 participants respec tively. the incidence of sca among male marathon run ners increased significantly between the years 2000 to 2004 and 2005 to 2010 from 0.71 to 2.03 per 100 000 which suggests that these events have over time at tracted more high risk men with known or occult cvd. these results demonstrated that the risk of sca dur ing full and half marathons is low. the final mile ac counted for almost 50 of the scds. the strongest predictors of survival of sca were early initiation of bystander administered cardiopulmonary resuscitation use of automated defibrillators and an underlying di agnosis other than hcm. postmortem data were avail able to determine the likely cause of sca in 31 of the 59 cases 53 . definite or possible hcm 50.4 and chd 16.1 accounted for the majority of scas. the frequency of scd and sca has also been report ed in 9 million triathlon participants 30 years of age.79 there were 135 scds or 1.74 per 100 000 participants. this rate was higher than previous estimates of triathlon scds112 and exceeded the incidence reported for mara thon running 1.01 per 100 000 .80 women comprised only 15 of the study population and their incidence of scd was 3.5 fold less than in men. most

8 6 periods. race experience was known for 68 participants of whom 26 38 were competing in their first triath lon. autopsies were performed on 61 victims of whom only 27 44 had relevant cardiovascular abnormalities including atherosclerotic cad and cardiomyopathy. these data suggest that sca and scd during mara thon running and triathlon participation are rare. cli nicians should be aware of the risks associated with underlying myocardial disease and atherosclerotic cad in patients contemplating such competition and of the increased risk among first time participants. the latter suggests that inadequate preparation or poor training contributed to the exertion related fatalities.29 34 the higher death rate during the swim portion of the tri athlon raises the possibility that factors associated with swimming such as increased central volume from im mersion 113 panic attacks leading to drowning 114 ad verse environmental conditions eg large waves or cool temperatures collisions among swimmers and the added challenges of water rescue could contribute to the fatal events.79 competitors at risk for cardiac events should be encouraged to maintain their pace through out the race because sprinting during the final miles has been associated with a heightened risk of acute cardiac events.115 other race related disorders includ ing hyponatremia and hyperthermia are uncommon causes of competitor s deaths.80 changing concepts of exercise related cardiovascular events predominant causes of exercise related scd in the young the previous aha statement noted that hereditary or congenital cardiovascular abnormalities such as hcm and coronary artery anomalies were the most common causes of pa related scds in young individuals 30 to 40 years old.30 many studies primarily from the united states identified hcm as the most common cause. more recent studies have questioned this conclusion and suggested that most cases of exercise related scd in high school or collegiate athletes have no cause iden tifiable at autopsy and are classified as either a sudden arrhythmic death56 or scd with a structurally normal heart snh .116 in a meta analysis examining scd in individuals 35 years of age that included 4605 subjects hcm was responsible for 10.3 of all deaths whereas 26.7 had snhs.116 there were 608 athletes included in this analysis of 34 studies published between 1990 and 2014 13.6 of the deaths were attributed to hcm whereas 18.1 were attributed to snh. differences in attributed causes appeared to depend on the geo graphic origin of the study. among north american athletes 27.0 and 10.0 of the deaths were at tributed to hcm and snh respectively whereas 5.7 and 23.1 of the deaths in european athletes were at tributed to hcm and snh. genetic studies can identify some of these victims with snh. an investigation of all scds in individuals 1 to 35 years of age in new zealand and australia identified 490 total cases of scd 40 of which were unexplained.117 genetic testing in 113 cases with snh identified a clinically definable genetic mutation for conditions such as cardiomyopathy or car diac arrhythmia in 27 of the samples. it remains difficult to determine with certainty the prevalence of the causes and the incidence of exercise related scd in the young. individual studies including those examining a geographically defined population often include a small number of subjects because of the rarity of exercise related scd. a prospectively collected emergency services cardiac arrest database in toronto canada identified scas during sports participation in individuals 12 to 45 years of age from 2009 to 2014.118 there were only 16 scas during competition and 58 scas during noncompetitive athletic activity during 18.5 million hours of observation. this yields an annual incidence in competitive athletes of only 0.76 sca per 100 000 individuals an estimate that can vary widely with the addition or subtraction of only a few cases. consequently the prevalence of any causative condition and the incidence of scd are highly variable depending on the number of deaths. even large meta analyses can be highly affected by the individual studies that com prise them. for example some studies of scd in ath letes included only deaths during pa 118 whereas others included deaths both during pa and at other times.119 the reasons for the apparent change in the preva lence of conditions causing scd between the previ ous30 and present document are probably multifacto rial. case collection bias in earlier studies is possible because the largest us studies originated from centers with expertise in hcm management.120 support for this possibility comes from the observed difference in causes of scd between european and north american studies.116 it is also possible that the wider apprecia tion of hcm as a cause of scd has led to alterations in medical management or to more effective screening and restriction of vigorous sports participation in indi viduals with hcm. increased appreciation of nonacute coronary lesions as a cause of exercise related scd in adults the previous aha scientific statement noted that both acs caused by plaque rupture or erosion and exer cised induced cardiac ischemia could precipitate exer cise related ami and scd.30 it was assumed but not directly stated that acs was primarily responsible for d ow nloaded from http ahajournals.org by on n ovem ber 17 2020 franklin et al exercise related acute cardiovascular events march 31 2020 circulation. 2020 141 e705 e736. doi

common in those with established chd. both his torical121 and more recent case series61 122 support the no tion that acute plaque disruption causes most exercise related amis. however recent evidence suggests that nonacute coronary disease and exercise induced myo cardial ischemia are the cause of most exercise related scds in middle aged adults and that acute plaque dis ruption is the second most common cause figure 5 .50 although a 12 year prospective population based study of scas in individuals 35 to 65 years of age identified 1247 events only 63 of the scas 5 occurred dur ing or within 1 hour of cessation of sporting activity.50 sports were defined as jogging basketball cycling golf volleyball tennis soccer and other gymnasium activities. scas at rest or during physical exertion not in the setting of sports eg domestic chores gardening sexual inter course were classified as nonsports. acs was identified in 33 of the sports related and 24 of non sports related cardiac arrests whereas 60 of the sports and 76 of the nonsports scas were associated with non acute coronary disease. a history of known heart disease was less common among the sports related scas 16 than the non sports related scas 30 . the possibility that exercise accelerates disease progression in inherited cardiomyopathies the previous aha scientific statement raised the pos sibility that exercise could increase the progression of cvd in patients with inherited cardiac conditions.30 this was speculative at that time but has subsequently been shown to occur in arvc which is caused by genetic abnormalities that affect desmosomal proteins. des mosomes are structures that provide mechanical and electrical connections between the myocytes. defects in desmosomal proteins make these myocyte connec tions vulnerable to disruption with subsequent fibro sis and fatty infiltration leading to the cardiomyopathy. penetrance of these genetic defects is variable possi bly because of environmental factors. it has long been known that prolonged endurance exercise acutely in creases right ventricular volume 123 which would stress these abnormal desmosomal junctions. exercise also elicits a larger increase in right ventricular than in left ventricular wall stress relative to rest.124 a series of hu man and animal studies have documented that exer cise is an environmental factor that accelerates arvc presentation and progression. among 87 desmosomal defect gene carriers endurance athletes and those with the most exercise participation were more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for arvc.125 the prognosis was also worse in desmosomal gene defect carriers who were athletes. similar findings have been documented by others who demonstrated an increased risk of ventricu lar tachyarrhythmias and death in arvc probands who participated in competitive sports before and after their diagnosis.126 participation in recreational as opposed to competitive sports did not increase risk.126 deleterious effects of exercise training have also been demonstrat ed in genetically modified murine models of arvc with defective genes encoding for the desmosomal proteins plakoglobin 127 plakophilin 2 128 and desmoplakin.129 despite the absence of absolute proof from random ized controlled clinical trials the deleterious effect of exercise training on arvc is now well accepted and recent guidelines recommend avoidance of intense ex ercise in patients with a clinical diagnosis of arvc.130 whether high volume high intensity endurance exer cise training could induce similar negative effects on other genetic cardiac conditions is unknown although exercise training might be deleterious in other inherited disorders of cardiac structural proteins such as lamin a c mutations.131 lqts is produced by defects in genes encoding for cardiac ion channels. most patients with lqts have defects in kcnq1 kcnh2 and scn5a.132 defects in kcnq1 are most common affect the i ks potassium channel and produce lqts 1. vigorous exercise and accompanying abrupt increases in sympathetic tone can acutely trigger syncope or sca in patients with lqt1. there are also data to suggest that increased vagal tone can increase cardiac arrhythmias in lqts 1 patients.133 in one study lqts 1 patients who demonstrated the greatest reduction in heart rate immediately after exer cise a marker of vagal tone were more likely to have figure 5. sudden cardiac arrest during sports and nonsports activities. top sudden cardiac arrest during sports n 63 . bottom sudden cardiac arrest during

hcm and brugada syndrome. exercise preparticipation and screening procedures professional organizations including the aha have traditionally promoted cost effective screening pro cedures eg survey questionnaires to identify at risk individuals who should be medically evaluated before initiating an exercise program. using data from 6785 adults 51 of whom were women 40 years of age collected in the 2001 to 2004 national health and nutrition examination survey it was estimated that 95.5 of women and 93.5 of men would be ad vised to consult a physician before starting an exercise program if they followed the aha american college of sports medicine acsm preparticipation questionnaire referral criteria.135 such results highlight the limitations of this self screening tool. the investigators concluded that in its present form increasing use of the question naire would result in escalating medical referrals and create yet another barrier for many sedentary adults to become more physically active. the value of routine medical screening procedures including physician evaluation and exercise testing as a preface to moderate to vigorous intensity exercise training remains controversial. the most recent acsm preparticipation health screening recommendations emphasize the important public health message of habitual pa for all and the need to eliminate barriers to adopting and maintaining a regular exercise pro gram.136 in these updated recommendations for exer cise preparticipation screening which were reiterated in the latest acsm guidelines 137 age cutoffs risk fac tor profiling and risk stratification terminology ie low moderate high were eliminated. the new algorithm focused primarily on 4 major variables 1 the indi vidual s current level of pa 2 known cardiovascular metabolic or renal disease cmrd 3 the presence of signs or symptoms suggestive of cvd and 4 the desired or anticipated exercise intensity table 2 .138 these characteristics as well as the potential hazards of unaccustomed vigorous pa were identified as im portant modulators of exercise related acute cardio vascular events. the term medical clearance replaced specific recommendations for a medical physical exami nation with or without exercise testing because it was thought these evaluations should be at the clinician s discretion. moreover patients with pulmonary disease are no longer automatically referred for medical evalu ation to exercise perhaps with the exception of those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which in current or former smokers often serves as an indepen dent predictor of cardiovascular risk.139 the new rec ommendations can be summarized by the following 4 points136 physically active asymptomatic individuals without known cmrd may continue their usual moderate or vigorous exercise and progress gradually as tol erated according to contemporary acsm guide lines.137 those who develop signs or symptoms of cmrd should immediately discontinue exercise and seek guidance from a medical professional before resuming exercise of any intensity. physically active asymptomatic individuals with known cmrd who have been medically evaluated within 12 months may continue a moderate inten sity exercise program unless they develop signs or symptoms which requires immediate cessation of exercise and medical reassessment. physically inactive individuals without known cmrd may begin light to moderate intensity exercise without medical guidance and provided table 2. potential risk modulators of exercise related acute cardiovascular

starting an exercise program regardless of the intensity. in summary engaging in regular moderate to vigor ous intensity pa improves crf and confers health ben efits among middle aged and older individuals with and without occult or documented atherosclerotic cvd. al though the exercise related health benefits clearly out weigh the associated cardiovascular risks any patient who was previously physically active and asymptomatic but who becomes symptomatic during exercise should immediately discontinue such activity and seek medical evaluation before resuming pa.136 137 increased assess ment of patients habitual pa levels and symptomatol ogy in healthcare settings with tools such as the pa vital sign constitutes an important step in facilitating the implementation of the latest acsm exercise prepar ticipation and screening recommendations. in contrast vigorous to high intensity pa in individuals with con genital or structural cardiovascular abnormalities eg marfan syndrome inherited cardiomyopathies and ar rhythmic syndromes should be undertaken with cau tion and with guidance from specialists in the manage ment of these conditions. such individuals should be discouraged from participating in highly competitive or strenuous endurance exercise without careful consulta tion but encouraged to engage in leisure time low to moderate intensity pa.29 screening exercise testing the us preventive services task force 2018 recom mendations advised against screening with resting or exercise electrocardiography in low risk asymptomatic adults to prevent cardiovascular events.140 the com panion us preventive services task force review of randomized controlled trials of screening with exercise ecgs found no improvement in health outcomes de spite focusing on higher risk populations with diabetes mellitus.141 the american college of physicians as part of the choosing wisely initiative also recommends avoiding screening exercise electrocardiographic test ing in asymptomatic individuals at low risk for chd.142 similarly a previous systematic review of the benefits and risks of structured exercise in people 75 years of age argued that mandatory preparticipation exercise testing in addition to being expensive and of unproven benefit could deter older people from exercising and cause more harm than good.143 these findings coupled with the extremely low incidence of exercise related cardiovascular complications in physically active asymp tomatic people the high rate of false positive exercise test responses in an ostensibly healthy population the costs of exercise testing and to evaluate abnormal re sults and the uncertainties associated with exercise in duced st segment depression in asymptomatic people with a low pretest risk of chd 94 further substantiate these recommendations.140 142 exercise testing can be helpful for assessing select ed cardiovascular disorders in patients at risk. peak or symptom limited exercise testing should be considered in high risk middle aged or older individuals particular ly inactive men with diabetes mellitus who wish to pur sue high intensity endurance sports.29 exercisers with abnormal findings during auscultation or on the resting ecg should also be considered for an echocardiogram. other asymptomatic patients who might benefit from exercise testing before beginning an exercise program include habitually sedentary individuals with multiple risk factors an elevated cac score 144 or a family his tory of premature chd who plan to start a vigorous exercise program those whom the clinician suspects may be ignoring symptoms or not giving an accurate history patients with critical aortic stenosis or to guide the management of those with valvular disease pa tients with atypical chest pain and those who complain of palpitations. a comparative study of exercise test ing only versus exercise testing with concomitant myo cardial perfusion imaging in symptomatic women with suspected chd found similar 2 year posttest outcomes highlighting the cost effectiveness of the less expensive conventional treadmill test.145 exercise testing is used in wolff parkinson white syndrome to risk stratify patients and specifically to determine whether there is a sudden complete disap pearance of accessary pathway conduction which is a favorable prognostic sign. treadmill or cycle ergom eter testing can also be helpful in diagnosing exercise induced catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia and to evaluate the effectiveness of adrenergic blockade or flecainide therapy in treating this arrhythmia.146 in contrast exercise testing has a limited role in diagnosing both lqts and brugada syn drome and in assessing the risk of exercise in patients with these electrocardiographic abnormalities. failure of the qt interval to shorten during exercise supports the diagnosis of lqts and exercise can also evoke the classic brugada pattern usually during recovery when vagal tone is increased.147 cardiac screening of young people before participation in sports there is insufficient evidence to justify routine cardiovas cular screening to prevent sports related acute cardiac events in young athletes. nevertheless this practice is common and typically includes a personal family medi cal history and physical examination with or without a d ow

increases false positive results with costly follow up noninvasive invasive studies and possible associated downstream psy chological harm.152 consequently a relevant aha ameri can college of cardiology scientific statement concluded that the available data do not support a significant public health benefit from using the 12 lead ecg as a universal screening tool for athletes.153 this contrasts with recom mendations from the european society of cardiology.154 there are multiple issues with routine cardiovascular screening in asymptomatic athletes. the true incidence of sports related sca is unknown. this has been gener ally estimated at 1 per 200 000 annually 155 but studies in accomplished athletes including national collegiate athletic association basketball players119 and english youth soccer players 156 have reported annualized rates of 1 per 5200 and 1 per 14 794 respectively. it is also not clear how truly asymptomatic athletes with a car diac condition should be managed. others emphasize that preparticipation screening of large groups of as ymptomatic athletes without known cvd will inevitably result in many false positive responses unnecessarily restricting pa among athletes who are free from cvd while simultaneously providing a false sense of security to those with unremarkable findings.151 other options are available to reduce exercise re lated cardiac events. coaches and athletes should be educated about possible warning signs symptoms eg syncope lightheadedness perceived palpitations or ar rhythmias that could be harbingers of acute cardiac events. the sudden unexplained death study reported that of 3775 scas in all age groups in the portland or metropolitan area between 2002 and 2015 186 5 occurred in the young mean sd age 25.9 6.8 years 67 male and the prevalence of warning signs before sca was 29 . moreover 26 of the 186 14 were associated with sports as a trigger.53 such symp toms mandate the immediate cessation of training competition and medical review. regular emergency drills bystander cardiopulmonary resuscitation and the use of automated external defibrillators have increased survival rates in the general157 and athletic158 popula tion. this writing group maintains that if cardiovascular preparticipation screening is offered to young athletes it should be voluntary and conducted by highly expe rienced clinicians but we recognize that the ability to alter survival by removal from sports participation or by other interventions has not been proven.156 159 can extreme exercise harm the heart long term exercise training alters cardiac structure and function. the athlete s heart is characterized by 1 enlargement of all cardiac chambers 160 2 improve ment of cardiac function161 and compliance 162 and 3 electrical remodeling such as sinus bradycardia sinus arrhythmia and first degree atrioventricular block.163 these exercise training induced adaptations are be lieved to be benign. emerging evidence however sug gests that over time high volume high intensity exer cise training can induce cardiac maladaptations such as an increased risk for af coronary artery calcification and myocardial fibrosis.164 hence there is debate as to whether intensive exercise can be harmful to the heart especially in some individuals.165 167 atrial fibrillation af is characterized by chaotic electrical activity that re places normal sinus rhythm and eliminates the contri bution of atrial contraction to left ventricular filling. af is the most common arrhythmia in the general popula tion 168 and the risk of af depends on subject charac teristics age race height health status weight blood pressure para sympathetic tone diabetes mellitus a history of mi or heart failure lifestyle factors alcohol use smoking pa obstructive sleep apnea 169 and car diac characteristics left atrial size and pressure .170 171 af is associated with an increased risk for stroke 172 mi 173 heart failure 174 and a multitude of adverse clini cal consequences.175 the relation between exercise and incident af is complicated. low levels of crfe 6 mets are asso ciated with a higher risk for af and individuals with higher levels of crfe 7.9 1.0 and 9.3 1.2 mets have a dose dependent decrease in af risk.176 177 similarly fit af patients have a lower risk for af recurrences during follow up than their unfit counterparts.178 af burden and symptom severity decreased significantly in patients with af who increased their fitness during an exercise training program versus those who failed to improve178 and among patients with af randomized to aerobic in terval training in a small clinical trial.179 although these observations suggest that fitter individuals have the lowest af risk there is substantial evidence that the risk for af is higher in athletes than in control subjects. high intensity exercise training180 and faster finishing times181 were associated with an increase of af in physi cally active older adults and long distance cross country skiers respectively. in the us physician s health study men who jogged 5 to 7 times per week had a 50 higher risk of af than men who did not exercise vigor ously even after adjustment for multiple cardiovascular risk factors.182 three meta analyses found that af risk was 2 to 10 fold higher in endurance athletes than in control participants.170 183 184 furthermore long term vol ume of vigorous endurance exercise ie 2000 hours of training169 or 20 years of training185 was strongly associated with an increased risk for lone af. these data d ow nloaded from http ahajournals.org by on n ovem ber 17 2020 franklin et al exercise related acute cardiovascular events march 31 2020 circulation. 2020 141 e705 e736. doi 10.1161 cir.0000000000000749e718 cl in ic al s ta te m en ts an d gu id el in es suggest that both low and very high volumes of exer cise training are associated with an increased risk for af whereas moderate exercise volumes appear to reduce risk. indeed a nonlinear meta regression analysis includ ing data from 19 studies and 29 855 af cases found a j shaped association between pa volumes and risk for af.186 individuals performing 5 to 20 met hours of pa per week had a significantly lower risk for af whereas physically inactive or highly active individuals 20 55 met h wk had similar relative risks for af figure 6 . a trend toward increased af risk is apparent among indi viduals reporting 55 met h wk equaling 9.5 hours of vigorous exercise training per week. the underlying mechanisms responsible for the in creased prevalence of af among athletes are unknown but several pathways have been proposed figure 7 . a prolonged 2 year training study incorporating high intensity training sessions showed that although left ventricular remodeling appears to plateau when train ing load plateaus left atrial remodeling continues even when the training dose is stable.187 this finding suggests that the atria are especially prone to dilation and re modeling in individuals who have trained at a high level for many years. interindividual genetic variability could also put some athletes at a higher risk of pathologi cal remodeling leading to lone af.188 190 furthermore increased parasympathetic tone191 in combination with left atrial enlargement192 is likely to contribute to the increased af risk but exercise induced sympathetic stimulation 193 sustained hemodynamic stress 194 and in flammation and oxidative stress195 could also contribute to the development of af in the most active exercisers. in summary the reported negative impact of high volume high intensity exercise on maladaptive re sponses specifically af varies considerably according to the quality of evidence available. indeed differences in study methodology have led to varying estimates re garding the magnitude of risk ranging from an 20 increase to a 10 fold risk of incident af.196 and for obvious reasons there may never be randomized con trolled quality evidence addressing the potential for an alternative hypothesis or u shaped relation between exercise and af. coronary artery atherosclerosis atherosclerotic cad is the main contributor to car diovascular morbidity and mortality in both men and women.197 atherosclerotic plaques have 2 common phenotypes stable versus unstable plaques.198 stable calcified plaques are characterized by a small lipid pool low concentrations of inflammatory cells and a thick fibrous cap that reduces vulnerability to plaque rupture and subsequent acs including ami.199 unsta ble mixed plaques are characterized by a large lipid pool high inflammatory activity and a thin fibrous cap which makes them more vulnerable to rupture and trig ger acs.200 both stable and unstable coronary plaque development and progression take decades and the presence of plaques does not necessarily cause clinical symptoms.200 exercise training reduces the risk for symptom atic atherosclerotic cad201 and its clinical sequelae.202 nevertheless several studies have found accelerated figure 6. dose response association between physical activity volume and af risk. individuals performing physical activity for 5 to 20 met h wk demonstrate a significant risk reduction for af whereas higher exercise volumes do not appear to attenuate af risk. a trend toward increased af risk is apparent among individuals reporting 55 met h wk. af indicates atrial fibrillation and met hrs week metabolic equivalents of task hours per week. adapted from ricci et

athletes. more importantly the most active athletes had a lower prevalence of unstable mixed plaques 48 versus 69 or 0.35 95 ci 0.15 0.85 and more often had only stable calcified plaques 38 versus 16 or 3.57 95 ci 1.28 9.97 compared with the least active athletes.34 merghani et al35 reported similar findings in a cohort of british male master endurance athletes and sedentary control participants. the athletes had a higher prevalence of atherosclerotic stable plaques with any degree of lumi nal stenosis compared with control participants 44.3 versus 22.2 p 0.001 . athletes demonstrated pre dominantly stable calcified plaques 73 versus 31 p 0.001 and fewer vulnerable mixed plaques 23 versus 62 .35 these observations demonstrated an increased prevalence of stable plaques among highly active middle aged endurance athletes. only 2 small studies n 4635 and n 26204 assessed atherosclerotic characteristics among female athletes. there were no differences in cac and plaque preva lence between female athletes and control participants in a british cohort.35 in contrast among american women undergoing computed tomography angiog raphy to evaluate cad athletes had lower coronary plaque prevalence and calcific plaque volumes than comparison women.204 because the reference group had a significantly higher prevalence of hypertension hyperlipidemia smoking and family history of cad the decreased plaque prevalence in the athletes could be more related to their low atherosclerotic risk profile than their exercise behavior. the clinical relevance of accelerated coronary ar tery atherosclerosis in athletes performing very high volume high intensity exercise is unknown. in clinical populations any cac or plaque presence represents a higher cardiovascular risk.205 206 on the other hand coronary artery size and dilating capacity are increased among athletes compared with control subjects 207 which could offset the apparently negative adapta tion of a higher cac. elevated cac scores in athletes might also indicate increased cardiovascular risk but definite data to evaluate this hypothesis are lacking.208 traditional cac risk predictions might not be applicable to athletes because physically active individuals have a lower risk for adverse cardiovascular outcomes than less active individuals with similar cac scores.209 the hypothesis that athletes are at reduced risk despite their higher cac scores is supported by the observation that the most active athletes had fewer unstable mixed plaques and more stable calcified plaques.34 35 mixed plaques are associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events whereas calcified plaques are associated with a lower risk.199 very high volumes of exercise training can therefore produce calcified stabilized plaques similar to the observation that statins can increase cac scores although they reduce atheroma volume and acute cardiovascular events.13 210 in a large cohort of men n 21 758 with more than a decade of follow up in the cooper clinic longitudinal study adjusted risk of cac score 100 was greater among individuals with very high levels of pa n 432 3000 met min wk com pared with those with lower activity levels. neverthe less their risk for all cause and cardiovascular mortality was not higher than that for those exercising at more moderate levels and it was lower than the least active cohort with similar cac scores. these findings refute the notion that high volume endurance activity 1 h d increases mortality risk regardless of cac level.211 several mechanisms have been proposed to explain increased cac after long term high intensity exercise training. exercise related changes in calcium metabo lism might contribute to the higher cac score in ath letes. vitamin d levels are lower in athletes 212 and low vitamin d levels are associated with increased cac in the general population.213 in contrast exercise acutely increases parathyroid hormone 214 which is associated with increased arterial calcification.215 alternatively vigorous intensity exercise can increase mechanical stress on the coronary wall causing disrupted flow pat terns 216 elevate blood pressure and cause shear stress each of which is associated with accelerated athero sclerosis.217 218 regular high intensity exercise training also transiently increases other nontraditional athero sclerotic risk factors including oxidative free radicals 219 dicarbonyl stress 220 and systemic inflammation.221 myocardial fibrosis myocardial fibrosis is characterized by collagen infiltra tion in the myocardial extracellular matrix and can de velop after injury from myocardial ischemia hypoxia inflammation hypertensive overload or combinations thereof.222 it is associated with increased myocardial stiffness 223 a higher incidence of ventricular arrhyth mias 224 225 and adverse cardiac outcomes.226 myocardial fibrosis is determined noninvasively using cardiac mag netic resonance imaging with gadolinium to determine lge a marker for myocardial fibrosis. the development of myocardial fibrosis generally occurs with cardiac re modeling secondary to diseases such as heart failure hypertension and valvular dysfunction 227 but sev eral studies have found evidence of lge in apparently healthy athletes.228 the prevalence of lge in endurance d ow nloaded from http ahajournals.org by on n ovem ber 17 2020

subjects table 3 . five found a higher lge prevalence in ath letes and 1 study found no difference between athletes and control subjects but the prevalence of lge varied widely across studies probably because of sample size differences. overall competitive endurance athletes had a substantially higher lge prevalence than control subjects performing pa at or below world health orga nization recommendations 12 versus 1.5 . several studies have attempted to identify factors as sociated with the presence of lge. long term exercise dose quantified as years of training230 235 and number of completed foot races 42 km203 230 was consistently found as a strong predictor for lge which suggests that high volume high intensity exercise training may in crease the risk of myocardial fibrosis. alternatively lge may also represent edema 236 inflammation 237 or myo cardial disarray238 rather than scar tissue. lge in athletes is often located where the right ventricle inserts into the ventricular septum. indeed 48 of athletes with lge had lge in the septum or right ventricular insertion points.228 short term and prolonged exposure to high cardiac strain can also cause edema induced lge.236 vigorous exercise elicits a greater relative increase in pulmonic than aortic systolic pressure estimated as an increase in wall stress of 125 versus 4 for the right and left ventricles respectively.124 this greater relative increase in wall stress imposed on the thinner right ventricular wall may contribute to edema and cardio myocyte damage in the septum and right ventricular septal insertion points. an animal study found higher levels of myocardial fibrosis in the right but not left ven tricle in rats running 60 min d for 16 weeks compared with sedentary controls.237 the amount of fibrosis was time dependent and accompanied by myofiber disarray leukocyte infiltration and expression of proinflamma tion factors il 1 interleukin 1 and mcp 1 mono cyte chemoattractant protein 1 which suggests that exercise can induce deleterious remodeling.237 it is un known how these findings translate to humans and future studies are needed to determine the nature and cause of lge in athletes and whether edema induced lge will regress remain unchanged or progress to scar tissue over time. there is little information about the clinical conse quences of lge in athletes. coronary revascularization was more common in one study of athletes with versus without lge 25 versus 1 p 0.001 during 21 3 months of follow up but it is unclear how knowledge of the fibrosis influenced clinical decisions.233 also nonsustained ventricular arrhythmias symptomatic ventricular tachycardia and progressive left ventricular dysfunction were found in a case series of athletes with subepicardial fibrosis.239 although overall systolic and diastolic cardiac function is usually normal in athletes with lge one study found wall motion abnormalities in myocardial segments with lge.240 however mas ters athletes have more compliant hearts and blood vessels than matched healthy sedentary individuals or table 3. overview of studies comparing prevalence of lge between male

signifi cance of this finding. curvilinear versus u shaped associations there is debate regarding the dose response relation ship between the volume of pa or exercise training and cardiovascular health outcomes. the prevailing dogma suggests a curvilinear relationship between exercise vol ume and cardiovascular health risks figure 8a which indicates that individuals performing none to very low volumes of exercise training have the highest risk for adverse outcomes whereas individuals who exercise the most have the lowest risk. epidemiological evidence strongly supports this relationship.38 242 243 wen et al38 found that 92 minutes per week of moderate to vigor ous intensity pa was associated with a 19 risk reduc tion for cvd mortality hr 0.81 95 ci 0.71 0.93 and a 14 risk reduction for all cause mortality hr 0.86 95 ci 0.81 0.91 . larger exercise volumes yielded greater health benefits with a maximal risk reduction of 45 for cvd mortality hr 0.55 95 ci 0.46 0.66 and 35 for all cause mortality hr 0.65 95 ci 0.60 0.70 in individuals performing 523 minutes of exercise per week. this exercise volume equals 3.5 to 4 times the amount of pa recommended in the 2018 federal physical activity guidelines 244 but an increasing number of athletes are exceeding this ex ercise volume during their training. arem et al242 investi gated the health benefits of a physically active lifestyle in individuals performing up to 10 times the world health organization recommended exercise dose. maximal mortality risk reduction hr 0.61 95 ci 0.59 0.62 occurred at an exercise volume equaling 3 to 5 times the recommendations. although the most active indi viduals 10 times the recommendations had a lower mortality risk hr 0.69 95 ci 0.59 0.78 compared with inactive control subjects their risk reduction was not as large as the group with optimal exercise volume. similar findings with large cis for risk estimates among the most active exercisers were observed in other stud ies38 82 242 243 245 247 table 4 and may be explained by the relatively small sample sizes of the most active sub groups typically 5 of the total cohort . the observation that very high volumes of pa may yield lower risk reductions than moderate to high activity volumes resulted in the extreme exercise hy pothesis 37 248 which postulates a u shaped relationship between pa volumes and health outcomes figure 8b and is characterized by partial loss of exercise induced health benefits among the most active individuals. however only limited data are available to support this hypothesis. schnohr et al246 found an increased mor tality risk for strenuous versus light joggers table 4 but there were few individuals in the most active group n 36 and only 2 deaths no cause of death identi fied resulting in an unusually large ci 0.48 8.14 and discussion about its interpretation.249 similarly lear et al245 reported less mortality reduction from recreational pa in the most active

among daily strenuous exercisers compared with con ventional exercisers might explain this finding in part and suggests that daily exercisers had a different life style than the typical endurance athlete. in aggregate there is currently no evidence to reject the curvilinear association figure 8a between exercise volumes and cardiovascular health outcomes with af as a possible exception. the health benefits of long term high volume high intensity exercise training are supported by data comparing life expectancy in elite athletes with con trol populations. kettunen et al250 reported that endur ance athletes n 437 hr 0.70 95 ci 0.61 0.79 and team sports athletes n 1046 hr 0.80 95 ci 0.72 0.89 had a lower all cause mortality rate than control subjects n 1712 whereas no difference was

of non natural causes of death ie suicide homicide in the former. similar data were found in a meta analysis of cohort studies among elite athletes. the standardized mortality ratio was significantly

observational data is the inability to differentiate cause and effect because some traits of elite athletes eg genetics socioeconomic status other lifestyle habits unrelated to pa can also affect longevity. a finnish study sought to minimize biologi cal and behavioral confounders by comparing life ex pectancy between finnish elite athletes n 900 and their brothers n 900 .254 elite athletes had a more ac tive lifestyle smoked less and lived 3 years longer than their brothers. these data suggest that both exer cise training and a healthy lifestyle contributed to the athletes increased longevity. strenuous exercise in cardiac patients supervised exercise training and habitual pa are a class 1 recommendation for cardiac patients255 257 because there is strong evidence that higher crf258 and high er pa volumes259 are associated with a lower risk for adverse outcomes. some have suggested using hiit with cardiac patients 260 because hiit elicits greater increases in fitness than

training modalities.263 264 these findings suggest that the exercise induced health benefits of hiit and mict in cardiac patients are comparable. a major concern in using hiit in cardiac patients is the increased risk for acute coronary events.265 data on the safety of hiit in clinical populations are scarce. a systematic review reported an adverse event rate of 8 using hiit in patients with cardiometabolic diseas es.266 adverse responses included vasovagal reaction nausea ventricular bigeminy atrial tachycardia tran sient cerebral ischemia and myocardial ischemia. an other study compared the cardiovascular event rates during hiit and mict in 4846 coronary patients par ticipating in cardiac rehabilitation.267 the absolute risk was low for hiit 1 event per 23 182 patient hours and mict 1 event per 129 456 patient hours but 5.6 times higher in the hiit group. although hiit is a purported time saving alternative to mict additional long term studies assessing the safety compliance and morbidity and mortality after hiit are needed be fore it can be widely adopted in patients with known or suspected cad especially in unsupervised non medical settings.268 several studies have explored the effects of high intensity or high volume pa on all cause and cardio vascular mortality in cardiac patients outside of formal cardiac rehabilitation programs. williams and thomp son269 reported a

findings suggest a u shaped relationship between exer cise volumes and health outcomes in cardiac patients however other studies suggest a curvilinear relation ship. stewart et al83 demonstrated a graded risk reduc tion for all cause mortality with increasing pa volumes among a large sample of chd patients n 15 486 . the largest risk reductions were observed in patients per forming any vigorous intensity pa irrespective of the pa volume. similarly moholdt et al273 found the lowest mortality risk in the most active 4 sessions wk chd patients n 3504 hr 0.77 95 ci 0.66 0.89 . the conflicting outcomes on the association between high intensity high volume pa and all cause and cardiovas cular mortality warrant further exploration. neverthe less all studies demonstrated that inactive patients have the highest mortality risk. such results emphasize the importance of regular pa for cardiac patients ideal ly via traditional medically supervised center or home based cardiac rehabilitation programs 274 as well as the importance of prescribing exercise volumes according to current aha american college of cardiology recom mendations table 5 . population attributable risk of excessive exercise pa the population attributable fraction is the proportion fraction of all cases in the population that can be at tributed to an exposure whereas the population at tributable risk is the proportion of the incidence of a disease related event in the population exposed and unexposed that is attributable to exposure. nawrot et al278 identified studies of specific triggers of nonfatal mi

to classify excessive exercise pa. also the cutoff of such a threshold dose is likely to be dependent on the outcome and may vary accordingly for coronary artery atherosclerosis myocardial fibrosis and af. for these reasons and because participation rates for endurance events such as half and full marathon running triath lon and long distance cycling have skyrocketed over the past 2 decades population risk estimates for excessive exercise pa are likely to be tenuous at best. recommending prudent exercise programs inactive patients with and without cvd should be en couraged to develop

the least active least fit individu als are at greatest risk for exercise related acute car diac events novice exercisers should follow a gradual increase in exercise intensity to increase crf without greatly increasing their cardiovascular risk by starting with vigorous exercise figure 4 .41 94 although most cardiac patients initiate exercise based rehabilitation programs at 2 to 3 mets uptitration of training in tensities over time is often suboptimal especially when direct early outpatient medical supervision and continu ous electrocardiographic monitoring have ceased.279 such patients should be counseled to gradually increase walking speed or grade over time to a moderate inten sity 40 59 functional capacity or 3.0 5.9 mets provided they remain asymptomatic136 this approach is prudent because these intensities are below the vigor ous pa level 60 functional capacity or 6 mets that is commonly associated with the triggering of exercise related acute cardiovascular events.41 patients should be counseled to include a warm up and cool down period during exercise training sessions to reduce the likelihood of inducing cardiac ischemia with sudden intense physical effort280 281 and to avoid the decrease in central blood volume that can occur with abrupt cessation of pa. previously inac tive patients with or without known cvd should also be advised to avoid unaccustomed vigorous physical exertion and highly strenuous activities eg racquet sports 95 snow removal106 to recognize potential exertion related warning signs and symptoms eg chest pain or pressure lightheadedness palpitations or arrhythmias that require cessation of exercise and medical evaluation and to adapt the exercise to the environment. because exercise in hot humid environ ments requires an increased heart rate response to handle the associated thermal load 282 patients should be advised to reduce the intensity of exercise under hot humid conditions. increased altitude reduces oxygen availability and further augments the cardio respiratory and hemodynamic responses to a given submaximal work rate thereby increasing cardiac de mands. accordingly individuals exercising at altitudes of 1500 m should limit the intensity of their exercise until acclimated.101 137 283 patients with cvd who are interested in participating in competitive sports should be evaluated and advised in accordance with the aha american college of cardiology eligibility and disqual ification recommendations for competitive athletes with cardiovascular abnormalities.284 286 prophylactic use of cardioprotective medications before exercise although some authors have suggested that individu als at risk for cad may benefit from taking aspirin or blockers shortly before competitive exercise 287 289 there are no definitive data that these medications prevent exercise related acute cardiac events. the rationale for low dose uncoated aspirin to reduce the elevated transient risk for exertion related ath erothrombosis is based on aspirin s ability to inhibit epinephrine induced platelet aggregation the obser vation that distance runners often show elevated in flammatory and hemostatic markers during races 290 292 the finding that aspirin discontinuation is associated with an increase in acute cardiovascular events 293 and the fact that aspirin use would preemptively provide athletes with the only medication with a class 1a rec ommendation for prehospital administration to treat acs.287 288 nevertheless in the timi ii study throm bolysis in myocardial infarction phase ii aspirin use did not significantly reduce the likelihood of ami dur ing physical exertion.289 similarly in the myocardial in farction onset study aspirin use did not alter the rr of triggering ami by heavy physical exertion.41 in the racer study kim et al80 also concluded that taking aspirin before endurance running events would have limited efficacy because acute plaque rupture and thrombosis were not found in any of the 5 runners who were discovered to have died with chd. taking short acting blockers before strenuous ex ercise has also been suggested 294 despite their potential to reduce exercise tolerance.295 297 tofler et al294 report ed that peak and average heart rates during standard ized bouts of physical exertion were significantly lower 30 minutes after ingestion of a blocker and aspirin than during a control period. similarly kokkinos et al298 concluded that blocker therapy could protect against excessive and repetitive elevations in blood pressure in hypertensive patients engaged in vigorous activities such as basketball tennis and racquetball. analysis of the timi ii database suggested that blockers provide the most compelling evidence for protection against physical exertion.289 in contrast the myocardial infarc tion onset study found that blockers did not signifi cantly reduce the likelihood of ami with heavy physical exertion although the rr was slightly lower in users rr 4.2 95 ci 1.8 9.9 than nonusers rr 6.2 95 ci 4.7 8.2 .41 collectively these data and more recent reports63 suggest there is insufficient evidence to recommend the routine use of either aspirin or blockers before strenu ous pa or sports participation. decisions to recommend these prophylactic agents requires assessment of the in dividual patient s risk and a discussion with the patient of potential risks and benefits. conclusions and perspectives there is abundant evidence that the amount of ha bitual pa and the level of crf are inversely related to the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.299 d ow nloaded from http ahajournals.org by on n ovem ber 17 2020 franklin et al exercise related acute cardiovascular events march 31

individuals figure 2 respectively 19 and elite crf is associated with an 80 reduction in all cause mortality.9 life expectancy at 50 years of age is 7 to 8 years greater in the most physically ac tive individuals.5 the benefits of exercise are not lim ited to healthy individuals because regular pa reduces recurrent events in patients with diagnosed cvd.2 300 lower event rates and higher survival rates have been reported in more active and more fit patients under going elective or emergent surgery24 25 or hospitalized for acs.23 vigorous intensity exercise appears to pro vide greater health benefits for primary and secondary prevention than moderate intensity exercise at a similar volume.38 40 hence the number of individuals perform ing high volume high intensity exercise training has increased appreciably in recent decades and partici pation rates have skyrocketed for endurance exercise events such as half and full running marathons triath lons and long distance cycling.42 in this statement we discussed the immediate and long term risks of exercise in healthy and diseased populations. exercise is known to acutely albeit transiently increase the rr for scd and mi. risks appear to be highest in men unaccustomed to exercise with substantially lower risks in regular exercisers and women. when expressed as an absolute risk acute events are very rare with only 0.31 to 2.1 scds per 100 000 person years.49 75 the most common cause of exercise related scd in middle aged and older adults is atherosclerotic cad. the most common cause in young individuals is controversial but recent studies suggest that scd with an snh and not hcm could be the most common cause.116 long term exercise training induces cardiac remod eling and limited evidence suggests that this may be maladaptive in some very active athletes. a j shaped association is present between pa volumes and risk for af.186 coronary artery atherosclerosis may be more prevalent in middle aged athletes than in inactive in dividuals 35 with the highest plaque prevalence in the most active athletes.34 calcified plaques presumably more stable plaques were more frequent in the most active athletes but this finding is not associated with increased cardiovascular events.211 collectively these data suggest that athletes with cac are at higher risk for mortality and acute cardiac events than athletes without cac however the risk for adverse cardiovas cular outcomes is lower in physically active people than their inactive counterparts with the same cac score. myocardial fibrosis also appears to be more common in adult competitive athletes and long term exercise dose is the best predictor for lge on cardiac magnetic reso nance imaging.228 relative to cardiovascular outcomes the clinical significance of accelerated coronary athero sclerosis and the presence of myocardial fibrosis in pre sumably healthy athletes requires additional study. most epidemiological studies report a decline in health risks with increasing pa volumes with a plateauing of the reduction at the highest exercise volumes although some have suggested that the relationship is u shaped with an increase in risk at the highest exercise volumes. longevity data argue against the u shaped relationship. elite endur ance athletes for example live 3 to 6 years longer than the general population.250 253 a large prospective cohort study also observed no upper limit for the reduced risk of all cause mortality with increasing crf.9 these find ings might not be applicable to cardiac patients because high intensity high volume pa may increase all cause mortality among these patients.164 269 272 also exercise is known to accelerate disease development and severity in patients with arvc and possibly with lamin a c muta tions but it is unclear whether exercise training can accel erate genotype to phenotype expression in other genetic cardiac diseases such as hcm and lqts. despite such caveats the benefits associated with long term exercise training outweigh the risks for the majority of the population. physical inactivity and sed entary behavior are a worldwide concern.3 interven tions are needed to increase population levels of pa. to promote and maintain health moderate intensity aerobic endurance pa for a minimum of 30 minutes on 5 days each week or vigorous intensity aerobic pa for a minimum of 20 minutes on 3 days each week or combinations thereof is recommended.301 ostensibly healthy inactive individuals starting to exercise should begin slowly generally with a walking program and increase the intensity and duration of exercise as their tolerance permits. patients with cvd seeking to greatly increase their pa intensity or volume should be evalu ated and advised in accordance with aha american college of cardiology and related guidelines.284 286 recommendations for exercise testing and prescrip tion in those with concomitant af have been published recently.302

traditional risk factors to identify individuals who may benefit from primary prevention therapies. incorporating nontraditional risk factors may improve traditional multivariate risk assessment. objective to systematically review evidence for the use of nontraditional risk factors ankle brachial index abi high sensitivity c reactive protein hscrp and coronary artery calcium cac in asymptomatic adults without known cardiovascular disease cvd . five key questions address clinical impact of nontraditional risk factor assessment versus traditional risk factor assessment with framingham risk score frs or pooled cohort equations pce kq1 performance of nontraditional risk factor assessment added to the frs or pce kq2 harms of nontraditional risk factor assessment kq3 and benefits kq4 and harms kq5 of nontraditional risk factor guided therapy. the united states preventive services task force uspstf will use this review to update prior recommendations on the use of nontraditional risk factors and the use of cvd risk assessment with the abi. data sources medline pubmed and cochrane collaboration registry of controlled trials through may 22 2017 to update existing systematic reviews supporting the previous uspstf recommendations. study selection we screened 22 707 abstracts and 483 full text articles against a priori inclusion criteria. for kq1 and kq4 we limited studies to trials reporting patient health outcomes. for kq2 we included risk prediction studies comparing a base model with traditional risk factors the frs or pce to extended models also including one of the three nontraditional risk factors abi hscrp cac predicting chd or cvd outcomes. for kq3 and kq5 we broadly included any study design examining harms of nontraditional risk assessment or nontraditional risk factor guided therapy. all kqs were limited to studies of asymptomatic populations that were conducted in developed nations and published in the english language. data extraction and synthesis two investigators independently and critically appraised each article that met inclusion criteria using uspstf s design specific criteria supplemented by the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic review of prediction modelling studies charms for risk prediction studies. poor quality studies were excluded. data from fair and good quality trials were abstracted into standardized evidence tools in distillersr with all data double checked by a second reviewer for accuracy. due to the limited number of included studies and or clinical heterogeneity of included studies we did not conduct meta analyses. we graded the strength of the overall body of evidence for each kq. main outcomes and measures for kq1 and kq4 outcomes included fatal and nonfatal cvd events e.g. myocardial infarction mi cerebrovascular accident cva and all cause mortality. for kq2 outcomes included any measure of calibration e.g. calibration plot hosmer lemeshow test or overall performance e.g. likelihood ratio tests r2 discrimination e.g. c statistic area under the curve auc or reclassification e.g. net reclassification index nri . for kq3 outcomes comprised any harms including radiation exposure due to ct imaging for cac and downstream health care utilization. for kq5 outcomes included any nontraditional risk factors for cvd iv kaiser permanente research affil iates epc serious adverse event as defined by the included study. results we included a total of 43 unique studies reported in 54 publications some studies were included for multiple kqs 1 study for kq1 33 studies for kq2 8 studies for kq3 4 studies for kq4 and 3 studies for kq5. kq1. one fair quality rct n 2 137 primarily designed to assess the impact of cac on cvd risk factors and downstream testing reported health outcomes and found no statistically significant differences in cvd events between cac score and control groups at 4 years. this study was not adequately powered for cvd outcomes. kq2. ten studies n 81 590 evaluated abi 25 studies n 269 449 evaluated hscrp and 19 studies n 69 720 evaluated cac. only four studies evaluated nontraditional risk factors in addition to the pce the rest used a base model of frs. overall limited data suggest all three nontraditional risk factors can improve calibration but the clinical impact of this change in calibration is uncertain due to the lack of reporting of preferred measures. we have more data to inform the change in discrimination and risk reclassification when adding abi hscrp or cac to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment. abi. one large individual participant data ipd meta analysis including 18 different cohorts demonstrated that abi can improve discrimination and reclassification in women to predict hard chd events when added to a published coefficient frs model with a c statistic change of 0.112 and net reclassification index nri of 0.096. this incremental improvement for women is most likely due to poorer discrimination of the base model in women compared to men. hscrp. results for hscrp are mixed. studies using published coefficients for frs demonstrate that hscrp can improve discrimination but results are inconsistent. one large ipd meta analysis a model development study that included 38 different cohorts demonstrated that hscrp only had very small improvement on discrimination. results for reclassification were similar and best evidence suggests an overall nri of less than 0.02. cac. based on a smaller body of evidence cac consistently appears to improve discrimination and reclassification in both published coefficient and model development studies nris ranged from 0.084 to 0.35. kq3. no studies address the harms of abi or hscrp. four studies n 11 473 demonstrated that radiation exposure from ct imaging for cac is low. two studies n 1 619 found no evidence for adverse psychological health outcomes for screening cac. two studies n 11 364 found no evidence that cac paradoxically increases cvd events. three studies n 13 204 found mixed results for cac on downstream health care utilization. best evidence suggests no overall increase in cardiac imaging or revascularization however this rct may have limited applicability to real world practice. one large retrospective study using medicare claims data found an association for higher utilization compared to hscrp or lipid screening. kq4. no trials directly compared treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors when added to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment however we included studies in which preventive nontraditional risk factors for cvd v kaiser permanente research affil iates epc therapies were guided by the use of nontraditional risk factors. two rcts n 4 626 found no benefit for abi guided low dose aspirin on cvd outcomes or all cause mortality at approximately 7 to 8 years of followup. one rct n 17 802 found a benefit for hscrp guided high intensity statin on cvd outcomes and all cause mortality at 1.9 years of followup. one rct n 1 005 found no benefit for cac guided moderate intensity statin at approximately 4 years but the study was inadequately powered to detect a benefit for cvd outcomes. kq5. low dose aspirin in the two rcts n 4 626 included for kq4 did not result in increased major bleeding events. high intensity statin in one rct n 17 802 included in kq4 was associated with an increase in incident diabetes but not with other serious adverse events. conclusions and relevance there is no direct evidence from adequately powered clinical impact trials comparing traditional cardiovascular risk assessment to risk assessment using nontraditional risk factors on patient health outcomes. the best available indirect evidence is mainly limited to studies evaluating the incremental value on discrimination and risk reclassification when adding abi hscrp or cac to the frs. we have much less evidence on the addition of these nontraditional risk factors to the pce compared to the frs and much less evidence to inform how these nontraditional risk factors improve calibration of traditional cardiovascular risk assessment. therefore the value of nontraditional risk factors to correct the over or under prediction of traditional risk assessment goes unanswered. overall abi may improve discrimination and reclassification in women when the base model performs poorly and cac can moderately improve discrimination and reclassification with an unclear effect on downstream health care utilization. one large rct shows that high intensity statin therapy in individuals with elevated hscrp and normal lipid levels can reduce cvd morbidity and mortality but it is unclear if these benefits would not also be applicable to individuals with normal hscrp. treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors has not been evaluated against treatment guided by traditional multivariate cardiovascular risk assessment.

condition definition cardiovascular disease cvd is a broad term encompassing diseases of the heart vascular diseases of the brain and diseases of blood vessels.1 2 it generally refers to atherosclerosis including but not limited to coronary heart disease chd also called ischemic heart disease cerebrovascular disease and peripheral artery disease pad . cvd can also include other diseases in the heart or vascular system such as heart failure atrial fibrillation congenital heart disease cardiomyopathies and rheumatic heart disease these conditions are not addressed in this report. prevalence and burden of cardiovascular disease cvd is the leading cause of death in the united states for both men and women accounting for about one in three deaths.3 although cvd mortality is decreasing over time in the united states it remains a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. despite a nearly 7 percent reduction in the number of cvd deaths per year between 2004 and 2014 an estimated 580 000 americans have a first myocardial infarction mi each year and about 610 000 experience a first cerebrovascular accident cva .3 the burden of cvd varies by age sex and race ethnicity. the prevalence of cvd increases dramatically with age. according to the most recent data from the centers for disease control and prevention 2006 2010 the prevalence of chd among adults ages 65 or older was 19.8 percent which was almost triple that of those ages 45 to 64 years 7.1 .4 similarly the cva prevalence of 8.3 percent among those age 65 years or older was almost triple that of those ages 45 to 64 years 2.9 .5 before age 75 years men experience higher rates of chd events as a proportion of cardiovascular events than women do whereas women experience more cva.6 men tend to experience chd events earlier in life. for example the mean age of first mi is 65.3 years for men and 71.8 years for women.3 in addition to age and sex differences certain racial ethnic groups experience an increased burden of cvd. from 2006 to 2010 american indians alaska natives had the highest prevalence of both chd and cva 11.6 and 5.9 respectively followed by african americans 6.5 and 3.9 latinos 6.1 and 2.5 whites 5.8 and 2.4 and asians native hawaiians other pacific islanders 3.9 and 1.5 .4 5 cardiovascular disease risk assessment cvd risk assessment integrates information about multiple risk factors with the aim of tailoring preventive treatment to maximize the potential benefit for the patient.7 8 risk assessment also offers a platform for discussion between provider and patient which may improve patients perception of risk and motivate initiation and adherence to medical or lifestyle therapy as well as physician adherence to best clinical practices.7 9 12 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 2 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc in past decades there has been a proliferation of cvd risk assessment models which are sometimes interchangeably referred to as equations tools calculators algorithms and scores. a 2016 systematic review of prediction models for cvd risk in the general population found 125 articles describing the development of 363 different models only one third of which 132 models were externally validated.13 several models have been externally validated are publicly available as calculators or tools and have been endorsed by clinical practice guidelines table 1 . these risk assessment tools vary across several important dimensions. the biggest differences among models are the predicted outcomes which may be chd specific or also include cva. additionally there is variation in the severity of outcomes included soft hard or fatal only . risk assessment tools also vary in the included risk factors. the basic risk factors include measures of age sex blood pressure total cholesterol and hdl c and smoking some include diabetes with or without hemoglobin a1c . family history of premature chd is included in selected tools but not those broadly recommended in the united states. recent risk assessment tools have incorporated race ethnicity. last risk assessment tools were developed in different derivation cohorts and have varying degrees of external validation. notable limitations of these models may include nonrepresentative or historically dated populations limited ethnic diversity in derivation and validation cohorts and outcome endpoints with poor reliability.7 14 15 the first widely used cvd risk prediction tool was the framingham risk score frs which was derived from the framingham heart study and includes the traditional risk factors of age sex total and high density lipoprotein cholesterol hdl c blood pressure smoking and diabetes. externally validated framingham based models include those by anderson wilson d agostino and the adult treatment panel atp iii .16 21 these models generally include the same risk factors left ventricular hypertrophy as determined by electrocardiography was included in one older model but subsequently dropped16 17 but predict somewhat different composite chd or cvd outcomes. of note the atp iii model was not intended for use in individuals with diabetes which was considered a chd risk equivalent.22 in 2013 the american college of cardiology american heart association acc aha guideline on the assessment of cardiovascular risk released the pooled cohort equations pce . the pce is based on four population based cohort studies and includes the same risk factors as the frs but inclusion of multi ethnic populations in the derivation cohorts also enabled race and sex specific equations for african americans and whites. included risk factors were selected based on their ability to improve the model and were not selected a priori to be the same as the frs.7 the pce predicts hard cvd outcomes mi cva chd or cvd mortality and includes diabetes as a risk factor.7 u.s. population estimates of the distribution of 10 year cvd risk from the pce using 2001 2010 nhanes data show that the vast majority of americans aged 40 to 49 years have an estimated 10 year cvd risk of 10 percent or less 94 of women and 88 of men . for ages 50 to 59 years 86 percent of women and 62 percent of men have estimated 10 year risk of 10 percent or less at ages 60 to 69 58 percent of women and 20 percent of men have estimated 10 year risk at this level.23 however external validation studies of various risk assessment tools show that models can over or under predict risk and no model has perfect calibration or discrimination. in fact there are tradeoffs between these two performance characteristics and a model cannot be perfect in both.24 the clinical importance of miscalibration both over and under prediction will depend on whether it is occurring above or below accepted treatment thresholds. direct comparison across nontraditional risk factors for cvd 3 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc models is complicated due to the differences in outcomes predicted definitions of risk categories and the availability of external validation cohorts with sufficient years of followup and robust outcome surveillance additionally there may be various degrees of heterogeneity in population risk across derivation and validation cohorts. a recent systematic review identified three trials comparing the use of cvd risk scores versus no use of risk scores or usual care and found that cvd risk scoring had little to no effect on cvd outcomes.25 this review found a larger body of evidence suggesting that cvd risk scoring is associated with small reductions in total cholesterol systolic blood pressure and cvd risk scores and that cvd risk scoring is associated with new or intensified lipid or antihypertensive medication management. however the quality of evidence for all outcomes was characterized as low with study limitations including limited power various sources of study bias and heterogeneity. therefore the true benefit of implementing cvd risk assessment tools on patient outcomes is uncertain. furthermore the comparative benefit of using different tools has never been evaluated in a trial assessing the impact of using one versus another model on cvd outcomes. this type of trial may never be done due to the large sample and long followup needed to detect differences in cvd event rates.26 use of nontraditional risk factors to improve risk prediction given that current risk assessment tools can under or overestimate cvd risk it follows that nontraditional risk markers or factors may be helpful in improving the calibration in addition to the discrimination and risk reclassification of currently used risk assessment tools. over 100 nontraditional risk markers have been proposed as candidates to improve cvd risk assessment the most commonly investigated are markers of inflammation and atherosclerotic burden.27 our review focuses on three of the most promising nontraditional risk factors ankle brachial index abi high sensitivity c reactive protein hscrp and coronary artery calcium cac score table 2 . in developing the pce the acc aha examined a number of promising nontraditional risk factors but did not include them because either 1 there was no significant improvement in discrimination when included in the model diastolic blood pressure family history of cvd moderate or severe kidney disease defined as egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 and bmi or 2 data were unavailable in the model development cohorts hscrp apolipoprotein apob microalbuminuria cardiorespiratory fitness cac carotid intima media thickness cimt and abi . based on expert opinion the acc aha guidelines did recommend that family history hscrp cac and abi be considered if risk based treatment was uncertain after using the pce. per experts family history did not improve discrimination but was free and easy to assess while cac appeared to be the most promising nontraditional risk factor there was not enough data or followup to include it in the pce d. lloyd jones personal communication 2015 . the acc aha guidelines recommended against using cimt. likewise several nontraditional risk factors were considered in alternate models of chd or cvd risk prediction but not included in the final model of other recommended risk assessment tools.28 currently only one u.s. based tool the reynolds risk score rrs incorporates nontraditional risk factors i.e. hscrp family history and a1c if diabetes is present . nontraditional risk factors for cvd 4 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc treatment approaches based on risk risk assessment guided therapy for the primary prevention of cvd includes statins aspirin and intensive lifestyle counseling.7 29 32 in the united states recommendations for initiation of antihypertensive medications are not based on multivariate risk assessment. both the uspstf and acc aha have 10 year risk based recommendations for the use of statins based on the pce.33 34 the uspstf has a b recommendation for a low to moderate dose statin to prevent cvd events in adults ages 40 to 75 years with no history of cvd one or more cvd risk factors and a calculated 10 year cvd event risk of 10 percent or greater there is a c recommendation to individualize the decision shared decisionmaking for those at 7.5 to 10 percent risk.19 33 the acc aha has a recommendation for moderate to high intensity statin treatment in adults 40 to 75 years of age with ldl c 70 to 180 mg dl without diabetes or cvd and with an estimated 10 year risk of 7.5 percent of higher class of recommendation i level of evidence a there is also a recommendation for moderate intensity statin treatment when 10 year risk is 5 percent to less than 7.5 percent class of recommendation iia level of evidence b . this recommendation represents a lower treatment threshold than in previous guidelines.19 the lowered threshold for discussion or initiation of statin therapy has reinforced concern about calibration of the pce.34 35 recent u.k. guidelines similarly lowered the threshold for statin therapy to a 10 percent or greater 10 year risk for cvd as assessed with the qrisk2 tool.36 all of these recommendations explicitly indicate an informed clinician patient discussion of benefits and harms prior to initiation of statin therapy. in 2016 the uspstf made a b recommendation for initiating low dose aspirin for the primary prevention of cvd and colorectal cancer in adults ages 50 to 59 years who have a 10 percent or greater 10 year cvd risk and a c recommendation to individualize the decision in adults ages 60 to 69 years with a 10 percent or greater 10 year cvd risk.37 intensive lifestyle counseling to promote a healthful diet and regular physical activity is recommended for people at elevated risk for cvd. in 2014 the uspstf made a b recommendation to offer or refer adults who are overweight or obese and have additional cvd risk factors i.e. hypertension dyslipidemia impaired fasting glucose or the metabolic syndrome to intensive behavioral counseling interventions to promote a healthful diet and physical activity.38 this recommendation also includes people identified as high risk based on cvd risk assessment. in the united states recommendations for initiation of antihypertensive medications are not currently based on estimated 10 year cvd risk.29 39 thresholds for initiation of blood pressure medication were raised in the most recent u.s. guidelines for patients at least 60 years old from 140 90 mm hg to 150 90 mm hg and adults with diabetes or chronic kidney disease from 130 80 mm hg to 140 90 mm hg .40 u.k. blood pressure guidelines however recommend initiation of antihypertensive drugs to patients with a 10 year cvd risk of at least 20 percent when clinic blood pressure is higher than 140 90 mm hg and elevated blood pressure is confirmed by ambulatory or home blood pressure monitoring.41 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 5 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc current recommendations and clinical practice in the united states cvd risk assessment whether with traditional or nontraditional risk factors intersects numerous current uspstf recommendations appendix a . uspstf recommendations exist for each of the traditional modifiable framingham risk factors cholesterol blood pressure diabetes and smoking as well as some nontraditional risk factors abi and screening modalities related to nontraditional risk factors carotid intima media thickness electrocardiography . several recommendations provide discussions of risk assessment in the top line recommendation or clinical considerations including screening for abnormal blood glucose and diabetes pad screening chd screening with electrocardiography healthful diet and physical activity counseling carotid artery stenosis screening aspirin use to prevent cvd and colorectal cancer and statin use for the primary prevention of cvd. a wide range of cvd and chd risk assessment models are recommended by international guideline bodies table 1 . some recommended models include nontraditional risk factors. although the acc aha did not formally include nontraditional risk factors they did recommend considering family history hscrp cac and abi if risk based treatment was still uncertain after a quantitative risk assessment was performed using the pce. the canadian cardiovascular society added family history to the framingham global cvd risk tool.22 qrisk2 the risk tool recommended by nice includes chronic kidney disease atrial fibrillation and a measure of social deprivation.36 assign the risk score recommended by the scottish intercollegiate guideline network sign also includes a measure of social deprivation.42 despite recommendations for periodic risk assessment a recent survey of u.s. physicians found that only 41 percent use cardiovascular risk assessment in practice even though awareness of available tools is high.43 the most commonly cited reason for not performing risk assessment is that it is too time consuming. even when risk assessment is conducted results are communicated to patients less than half the time limiting its potential impact to motivate behavior change or adherence to therapy.43 a 2012 survey of european physicians found that over 90 percent of them felt that risk assessment tools miss important risk factors and over one third felt that these tools overestimate risk.44 the uptake of cardiovascular risk assessment using nontraditional risk factors is largely unknown and likely varies across practice settings. previous uspstf recommendation in 2009 the uspstf concluded that the evidence was insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of using nontraditional risk factors studied to screen asymptomatic men and women with no history of chd to prevent chd events i statement .45 the nontraditional risk factors included in this previous recommendation were hscrp abi leukocyte count fasting blood glucose level periodontal disease cimt cac score on electron beam computed tomography ebct homocysteine level and lp a level. in 2013 the uspstf again concluded that there nontraditional risk factors for cvd 6 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc was insufficient evidence to assess the balance of benefits and harms of screening for pad and cvd risk assessment with the abi in adults i statement .46 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 7 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc chapter 2. methods scope and purpose this systematic review examined the evidence for using nontraditional risk factors abi hscrp and cac in cardiovascular risk assessment. for the purposes of this review we use the terms risk assessment and risk prediction as synonyms. our review focuses specifically on these three risk factors and was informed by a scan of existing literature and guidelines consultation with experts in the field consultation with the uspstf and a period of public comments. these three nontraditional risk factors satisfied our a priori criteria for relevance that is a novel risk factor should 1. be easily and reliably measured i.e. laboratory radiographic or clinical measurement should have accepted population reference values . 2. have established predictive ability beyond traditional risk factor assessment i.e. independently associated with chd or cvd risk using measures of risk association including hazard ratios rate ratios or odds ratios . 3. have data to describe the prevalence and distribution of nontraditional risk factor status by traditionally identified risk groups i.e. adequate variation in the distribution of abnormal and normal values . the uspstf will use this review to update its 2009 recommendation statement on screening for coronary heart disease with nontraditional risk factors45 and its 2013 recommendation on cvd risk assessment with the abi.46 key questions and analytic framework in consultation with members of the uspstf we developed an analytic framework figure 1 and five key questions kqs to guide our review. 1. compared with the pooled cohort equations or framingham risk factors alone does risk assessment of asymptomatic adults using nontraditional risk factors followed by treatment specific to risk level lead to reduced incidence of cardiovascular events e.g. myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident and or mortality 2. does use of nontraditional risk factors in addition to traditional risk factors to predict cardiovascular disease risk improve measures of calibration discrimination and risk reclassification 3. what are the harms of nontraditional risk factor assessment 4. does treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors in addition to traditional risk factors lead to reduced incidence of cardiovascular events e.g. myocardial infarction cerebrovascular accident and or mortality 5. what are the harms of treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors nontraditional risk factors for cvd 8 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc data sources and searches we conducted a search to identify literature published since a set of previous reviews for the uspstf through may 22 2017. we worked with a research librarian to develop our search strategy which included the following databases medline pubmed published supplied records only and the cochrane central register of controlled trials appendix b . for hscrp we bridged from the previous uspstf review by buckley and colleagues47 and searched from 2007 for cac we bridged from the previous review by helfand and colleagues48 and searched from 2008. for abi we bridged from the review by lin and colleagues49 and search from 2012. we evaluated all previously included studies from the prior reviews for the uspstf as well as reference lists of other systematic reviews and meta analyses to identify additional studies not identified in our literature searches. we also searched clinicaltrials.gov and who international clinical trials registry platform ictrp for relevant ongoing trials appendix b . we managed all literature search results using endnotetm version 7.3.1 thomson reuters new york ny . study selection one investigator independently prescreened titles and abstracts of a subset of studies that were electronically identified as having keywords pertaining to an excluded setting population or condition in the abstract or keyword fields of endnote appendix b table 1 abstracts deemed potentially relevant during single review were advanced for dual review. of the 22 707 total citations screened 8 013 were prescreened by a single reviewer of these 265 were identified as potentially relevant and moved forward for dual review. two investigators independently reviewed 483 full text articles against prespecified inclusion criteria appendix b table 2 . our review focuses on the benefit and harm of adding abi hscrp or cac to the current standard of practice of cvd or chd risk prediction using traditional risk factors i.e. the pce or the frs . specifically eligible base models had to include age sex systolic blood pressure antihypertensive medication use total cholesterol hdl and current smoking status. models were eligible with or without the inclusion of race ethnicity and diabetes as these predictors are included in some but not all eligible base models.7 18 20 studies with additional variables e.g. measures of kidney function family history left ventricular hypertrophy in their base models were excluded as this would preclude us from isolating the effect of the nontraditional risk factor of interest. if we could not isolate the effect of newly added risk factors we excluded extended models comprising multiple nontraditional risk factors. thus the reynolds risk score which includes hscrp family history and hba1c for individuals with diabetes in the model for women but not men 15 50 was not evaluated in this review information about its performance in external validation studies is described in the discussion. we included studies or cohorts of adults without known cvd in developed countries as defined using the human development index by the united nations development program. for kq1 we included randomized or controlled clinical trials comparing traditional risk assessment to risk assessment including nontraditional risk factors that reported patient health outcomes. for kq4 we included randomized or controlled clinical trials of treatment guided by nontraditional risk nontraditional risk factors for cvd 9 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc factor assessment in addition to traditional risk assessment versus no treatment or usual care that reported patient health outcomes. patient health outcomes were defined as cvd events e.g. mi cva and or mortality e.g. cvd specific or all cause . for kq2 we included individual participant data ipd meta analyses trials or well designed prospective cohort studies evaluating risk prediction in models with traditional risk factors base model compared to models additionally including abi hscrp or cac extended model . we included any measure of calibration discrimination or reclassification as risk assessment performance measures. for kq3 and 5 studies examining the harms of risk assessment or treatment guided by risk assessment we included trials prospective and retrospective cohort studies and well designed case control studies examining harms. we defined harms as any serious adverse event i.e. unexpected or unwanted medical attention resulting from risk factor assessment itself or aggressive risk factor modification resulting from risk assessment. for cac assessment we also included radiation exposure from ct as a potential harm i.e. studies included for other questions that reported radiation exposure or studies with the explicit aim to measures evaluate radiation exposure . all kqs restricted inclusion to good or fair quality studies published in english. quality assessment and data abstraction two reviewers independently and critically appraised articles meeting inclusion criteria. for trials and cohort studies we used the uspstf s design specific quality criteria and items from the newcastle ottawa scale.51 52 for risk prediction studies we adapted and tailored items from the checklist for critical appraisal and data extraction for systematic review of prediction modelling studies charms 53 and selected domains pertaining to ipd meta analyses if applicable 54 appendix b table 3 . we rated articles as good fair or poor quality. in general a good quality study met all criteria. a fair quality study did not meet or it was unclear whether it met at least one criterion but had no known important limitations that could invalidate its results. a poor quality study had a single fatal flaw or multiple important limitations. two studies both for kq2 were excluded for poor quality.55 56 both had multiple limitations including nonrepresentative sampling of patients self reported outcomes limited duration of followup and or very small number cvd events. we excluded poor quality studies from this review. disagreements about critical appraisal were resolved by consensus and if needed in consultation with a third independent reviewer. one reviewer abstracted key elements of included studies using standardized evidence tables in distillersr evidence partners ottawa canada . a second reviewer checked the data for accuracy. for each study we abstracted general characteristics of the study e.g. author year recruitment study design length of followup clinical and demographic characteristics of the included population e.g. age race ethnicity means or proportions of traditional cardiovascular risk factors characteristics of the base model e.g. published coefficient vs model development recalibration outcome predicted by the model treatment details if applicable kq4 and outcomes e.g. cvd outcomes mortality risk prediction performance . the performance of risk prediction models or the comparative performance of one model to another can be described using a few key dimensions 57 59 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 10 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc calibration agreement between observed and predicted outcomes discrimination ability to distinguish between individuals who will and will not have an event reclassification ability to correctly reassign people into clinically meaningful risk strata we abstracted any of these performance measures reported by the included studies. descriptions of specific measures are provided in table 3 additional measures to describe test performance exist such as the greenwood nam d agostino calibration approach 60 but we only describe those reported in included studies. studies reporting measures of association e.g. hazard ratios between abi hscrp or cac and cardiovascular outcomes that did not also report one of the three risk prediction outcomes above were excluded. for calibration we preferred graphical representations because they are more intuitive and can indicate the direction of miscalibration. when reported we extracted information on the total number of observed o and expected e events the o e ratio is a proxy for overall model calibration i.e. strongly related to the calibration in the large measure and can be compared across studies. however both calibration plots and o e ratio are rarely reported. the hosmer lemeshow test was the most commonly reported measure of calibration. several measures including r2 and the brier score are considered overall performance measures in that they are integrated measures of calibration and discrimination 57 59 we report these with calibration. we used the c statistic and change in the c statistic as our primary measures of discrimination. although we recognize the difference between the area under the curve auc and the c statistic harrell s c we summarize these together. we used the net reclassification index nri as our primary measure of reclassification and report event and nonevent nri separately where possible. idi was included in the appendix appendix e but not discussed in detail due to the very sparse reporting of this measure. data synthesis and analysis our analyses were organized by kq. we address the clinical value of risk assessment hierarchically meaning does measurement of the nontraditional risk factor 1. demonstrate a clinical benefit on cvd or mortality outcomes to those reclassified using nontraditional risk factors kq1 2. improve discrimination or calibration kq2 3. correctly reclassify those with a predicted intermediate risk into higher or lower risk or demonstrate the ability to correctly reclassify those whose risk has been over or underestimated into a more accurate risk group e.g. from a high risk to lower risk group kq2 or 4. result in any serious harm kq3 we also summarized the evidence on the effectiveness kq4 and harms kq5 of various preventive treatments guided by the addition of nontraditional risk factors to traditional risk factor assessment. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 11 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc for kq2 we stratified our analyses based on a few important dimensions of heterogeneity 1 choice of the frs18 20 or the pce7 as the base model 2 prediction of cvd vs chd outcomes and 3 type of model design. in addition studies used different cvd and chd outcomes or events. the most severe of these outcomes i.e. fatal or nonfatal mi or cva are commonly referred to as hard outcomes. other studies include events of differing degrees of severity e.g. angina transient ischemic attack tia claudication and utilization outcomes e.g. revascularization these are commonly referred to as soft outcomes. risk prediction studies evaluating the pce as a base model used cvd outcomes however studies evaluating the frs as a base model used both chd and cvd outcomes with varying events or endpoints included in these outcomes table 4 . we prioritize analyses using the pce base model with hard cvd outcomes and the frs base model with hard chd outcomes. while we included models predicting fatal outcomes only we do not discuss these results unless it was the only outcome reported predicted. risk prediction studies evaluating the added prognostic value of abi hscrp or cac were either pragmatic in design i.e. preserved the coefficients from the published model or model development studies. studies that used the original published coefficients of the frs18 20 or the pce7 were considered preferable to model development studies on the basis that these studies are the most applicable to current practice in these studies nontraditional risk factors of interest were added to publicly available externally validated models used in clinical practice. we refer to models with this design as published coefficient models. this term is used to designate the specific application of an externally validated model in which the original coefficients are preserved with or without updating to a local population . we use the term external validation more broadly to refer to the generalizability or transportability of a clinical prediction model to other plausibly related populations 61 both the frs and pce as base models are externally validated. however because the minority of included studies preserved the original published coefficients we also discuss studies that included the same predictor variables in the frs or pce but with locally developed coefficients from newly fitted models e.g. full recalibration de novo model development . we refer to models with this design as model development studies. although such model development studies are less clinically relevant they do serve the explanatory purpose of evaluating more generally whether an added nontraditional risk factor improves model performance. in this report the terms frs and pce will refer to published coefficient models and the terms frs variables and pce variables will be used to refer to model development studies. in addition to these dimensions of heterogeneity i.e. choice of base model corresponding cvd or chd outcomes and type of model design we a priori looked at other characteristics that might explain differences in findings across studies including updating the model to the local studied population i.e. recalibration among published coefficient models . we considered such studies to more conservatively estimate the incremental value of abi hscrp or cac.62 continuous versus dichotomized or categorized predictors. treatment of continuous risk predictors as dichotomous or categorical variables results in loss of statistical power and compromises predictive performance.63 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 12 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc

strata for risk reclassification . sex where subgroup analyses allow . presence of diabetes where subgroup analyses allow . race ethnicity where subgroup analyses allow . often we identified multiple publications for model development analyses for any given outcome from the same cohort. in these instances we preferred analyses with the larger sample size n and or the longest followup largest number of events . for bodies of evidence where ipd meta analyses were included 65 66 we used the ipd meta analyses as the central piece of evidence and only analyzed separate studies from those included cohorts if different and preferable base models outcomes types of model design or performance measures were reported in separate publications. we did not quantitatively synthesize information because of the limited number of studies for most key questions as well as the clinical and methodological heterogeneity of included studies for kq2 i.e. differences in types of model design populations base models chd or cvd outcomes definition of risk strata and performance or statistical measures reported . if the change in discrimination between base and extended models was not reported and it rarely was we calculated a crude change by subtracting the base model discrimination from that of the extended model. however confidence intervals for these differences could not be calculated. as there is no guidance in existing literature about how to characterize the magnitude or clinical meaning of changes in discrimination kq2 67 we used the following definitions for practical reasons. for changes in the c statistic the term large is used to denote changes of 0.1 or greater moderate for changes of 0.05 0.1 small for 0.025 0.05 and very small for changes less than 0.025. c statistics range from 0.5 to 1.0 the 0.1 cutpoint for large was set because it represents 20 percent of the possible range. a change in c statistic of 0.025 approximates a 5 percent higher sensitivity when specificity is 50 percent.68 when a reclassification table for an entire study population was available we calculated the event nri nonevent nri and bias corrected nri for the immediate risk group nriint if not reported.69 70 we abstracted uncorrected nriint if a reclassification table was not provided however uncorrected nriint can overestimate the reclassification effect.71 details of the calculations for nris and confidence intervals are included in appendix b . grading the strength of the body of evidence we graded the strength of the overall body of evidence for each kq. we adapted the evidence based practice center approach 72 which is based on a system developed by the grading of recommendations assessment development and evaluation grade working group.73 our method explicitly addresses four of the five evidence based practice center required domains consistency similarity of effect direction and size precision degree of certainty around an estimate reporting bias potential for bias related to publication selective outcome reporting or nontraditional risk factors for cvd 13 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc selective analysis reporting and study quality i.e. study limitations . we did not address the fifth required domain directness as it is implied in the structure of the kqs i.e. pertains to whether the evidence links the interventions directly to a health outcome . consistency was rated as reasonably consistent inconsistent or not applicable e.g. single study . precision was rated as reasonably precise imprecise or not applicable e.g. no evidence . reporting bias was rated as suspected undetected or not applicable e.g. when there is insufficient evidence for a particular outcome . study quality reflects the quality ratings of the individual studies and indicates the degree to which the included studies for a given outcome have a high likelihood of adequate protection against bias. the body of evidence limitations field highlights important restrictions in answering the overall kq. we graded the overall strength of evidence as high moderate or low. high indicates high confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effects. moderate suggests moderate confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research may change our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate. low indicates low confidence that the evidence reflects the true effect and that further research is likely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate. a grade of insufficient indicates that evidence is either unavailable or does not permit estimate of an effect. two independent reviewers rated each kq according to consistency precision reporting bias and overall strength of evidence grade. we resolved discrepancies through consensus discussion involving more reviewers. expert review and public comment a draft research plan for this review was available for public comment from june 11 to july 8 2015. the draft version of this report was reviewed by six invited experts and two uspstf federal partners. experts were selected based on their expertise on fundamental methodologic and content aspects of the review i.e. risk prediction cardiovascular epidemiology abi hscrp and cac and were selected to obtain diverse informed perspectives including developers of included risk prediction models researchers who have validated risk prediction models guideline developers trialists specialists in cardiovascular imaging and practicing clinicians. all expert comments were considered and selected comments from experts were used to clarify and extend the synthesis of evidence to ensure accuracy and address scientifically relevant concerns. all comments were shared with members of the uspstf and the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq . additionally a draft of the full report was posted on the uspstf web site from january 16 2018 to february 12 2018. based on the public comments received we made a few minor revisions to the evidence report including addition of background information about the distribution of 10 year cvd risk in the u.s. and additional clarification about included and discussed studies and analyses. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 14 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc uspstf involvement this systematic review was funded by ahrq under contract to support the uspstf. we consulted with uspstf liaisons at key points in the review including the development of the research plan i.e. kqs analytic framework and inclusion and exclusion criteria and the finalization of the systematic review. an ahrq medical officer provided project oversight reviewed the draft and final versions of the review and assisted with public comment on the research plan and

using nontraditional risk factors followed by treatment specific to risk level lead to reduced incidence of cardiovascular events and or mortality we included only one study that examined the effectiveness of nontraditional risk factor assessment on patient health outcomes.11 this fair quality randomized controlled trial rct n 2 137 was primarily designed to assess the impact of cac screening on cvd risk factors and downstream testing but it also reported health outcomes and therefore is included for this key question. the early identification of subclinical atherosclerosis by non invasive imaging research eisner trial conducted in the united states randomized volunteers to undergo ct scanning for cac scoring in addition to the frs versus no ct before risk factor counseling table 6 . the primary outcome was a change in cvd risk factors and framingham risk score at 4 years. participants were middle aged adults with cvd risk factors but no known cvd or symptoms table 7 . this study found no statistically significant difference in mi mortality or combined mi and mortality at 4 years between the two groups table 8 . the trial was well conducted but did not have adequate sample size and length of followup to detect differences in patient health outcomes. this study is discussed with respect to downstream testing and radiation dose in kq3 and to adherence to risk factor modification in the discussion section. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 16 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc kq2. does use of nontraditional risk factors in addition to traditional risk factors to predict cvd risk improve measures of calibration discrimination and risk reclassification summary we included 33 studies reported in 43 articles that evaluated abi hscrp and or cac in addition to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment using one or more measures of calibration discrimination and or risk reclassification. ten studies including 1 large ipd meta analysis evaluated abi 25 studies including 1 large ipd meta analysis evaluated hscrp and 19 studies evaluated cac table 9 . this body of evidence answers two related yet distinct questions 1 studies using the published coefficients answer what is the added predictive value of assessing abi hscrp or cac after using a traditional risk assessment tool like the frs recommended by atp iii or the pce recommended by the acc aha and 2 model development studies answer what is the incremental predictive value of adding a nontraditional risk factor to traditional cvd risk factors when developing a risk prediction tool only four studies evaluated abi hscrp and or cac in addition to the pce 89 90 111 112 most used a base model of the frs. the vast majority of the included studies are model development studies as opposed to studies using published coefficients without external validation. overall while good measures of calibration are not well reported in this body of literature it appears that all three nontraditional risk factors can improve calibration of chd or cvd risk prediction when added to the frs or pce the magnitude and clinical impact of this improvement is not certain. calibration plots and o e ratio are preferable because of their ease of interpretation and ability to indicate direction of miscalibration but are rarely reported. discrimination and reclassification are commonly reported. the improvement in discrimination in large part is dependent on the underlying performance of the base model such that if the frs or pce has poor discrimination the improvement in discrimination by adding abi hscrp and or cac is larger. two included studies recalibrated the frs or pce to the analyzed population 90 91 because this will improve the base model discrimination estimates of improvement in with the addition of a nontraditional risk factor will be conservative i.e. underestimate the change in discrimination with the addition of a nontraditional risk factor to a non recalibrated based model . changes in discrimination were most often less than 0.025 for abi and hscrp and it is difficult to interpret the clinical impact of very small or small improvements in auc or c statistic. measures of reclassification may be more clinically intuitive but there are limitations in its interpretation the most common measure of reclassification reported in this literature is the total nri. total nri is the sum of event and nonevent nri and is not weighted by the prevalence of events and nonevents. because nonevents are substantially more common the total nri may overstate the improvement in reclassification. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 17 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc abi based on one large ipd meta analysis by the abi collaboration that includes 18 different cohorts abi can lead to potentially meaningful improvements in discrimination c statistic change 0.1 and reclassification nri 0.09 in women to predict hard chd events when added to the frs using published coefficients. the incremental improvement in c statistic and nri for women is most likely due to the poorer discrimination of the base model in women compared to men in other words abi is not inherently superior in women than in men but is compensating for the poorer performance of the frs in women than in men. examination of separate components of the nri event and nonevent nri suggests that improvement in reclassification comes from women who had events being appropriately reclassified as having a higher risk in contrast women who did not have a cardiovascular event which is the majority of the population were inappropriately reclassified as having a higher risk i.e. a negative nonevent nri . in the model development analyses conducted by the abi collaboration the discrimination for the base model was higher in women compared to men the opposite of what was observed using published coefficients and subsequently the improvement in discrimination and reclassification observed using published coefficients was not observed i.e. no statistically significant change in discrimination or nri . based on this ipd meta analysis abi appears to be most promising for women at intermediate risk 10 19 10 year risk for hard chd outcomes with an nri of 0.288 95 ci 0.064 to 0.513 . however the abi collaboration analyses were restricted to whites only. hscrp results for hscrp are less consistent and while hscrp can improve discrimination and risk reclassification the improvements are small at best. studies using published coefficients for the frs demonstrate that hscrp can improve discrimination but results are not consistent and the higher estimates of improvement in discrimination which are small 0.03 likely represent an upper bound of improvement. based on one large ipd meta analysis a model development study by the emerging risk factors collaboration that included 38 different cohorts hscrp had a very small improvement on discrimination to predict hard chd 0.005 or cvd 0.004 events. correspondingly the improvement in nri is 0.015 95 ci 0.008 to 0.023 . sex stratified analyses suggest that improvement in discrimination and reclassification may be better for men than women. cac cac has the smallest body of evidence owing to the smaller sample sizes of included cohorts no ipd meta analysis presents results for the incremental predictive value of cac. nonetheless cac consistently appears to result in at least small and often larger improvements in discrimination in studies evaluating hard outcomes in all participants using published coefficients 0.02 to 0.102 and model development studies 0.02 to 0.05 . five studies report improvement in discrimination and reclassification from adding cac to the pce or models with pce variables three published coefficient studies evaluating just two cohorts and two model development studies. categorical nri from model development studies in all participants ranged from 0.14 to 0.319 continuous nri ranged from 0.20 to 0.28 evaluation of separate nontraditional risk factors for cvd 18 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc components of the nri shows that improvements in nri are consistently driven by event nris much larger than nonevent nris which were commonly negative when reported and sometimes statistically significant. a limited number of studies report sex stratified analyses however without ipd meta analyses it is unclear if there are any consistent sex differences in discrimination or reclassification. the bias corrected nriint was not consistently reported or calculable. based on limited data the bias corrected nriint is not consistently greater than the nri for all participants. direct comparisons of abi hscrp and cac nine studies evaluate more than one nontraditional risk factor and therefore allow for more direct comparison across abi hscrp and cac table 10 . overall cac appears to be the most promising nontraditional risk factor to add to traditional cardiovascular risk factor assessment. only two studies using published coefficients evaluated multiple nontraditional risk factors one evaluated both the pce and frs. this study using the multi ethnic study of atherosclerosis mesa cohort found no improvement in discrimination or reclassification for abi and hscrp but the study was limited to lower risk people because participants taking a statin were excluded from the analyses. however in this study cac did improve both discrimination and reclassification. the other published coefficient analysis using the heinz nixdorf recall cohort evaluated both abi and cac added to the frs and similarly found greater improvement for cac than abi. six model development studies evaluated more than one nontraditional risk factor in addition to the frs to predict hard chd or soft cvd events. five of these six studies included cac and found statistically significant improvements in discrimination and reclassification these improvements were greater than effects seen for either abi and or hscrp. detailed results for abi description of cohorts we included 10 unique

evaluated five different models employing published coefficients of the pce or frs.66 90 91 114 seven model development studies used frs variables.66 75 79 82 95 generally the intended outcome of interest for the frs is chd hard outcomes e.g. atp iii or soft cvd outcomes e.g. d agostino 2008 and for the pce cvd hard outcomes. two cohorts nijmegen and regicor report soft as opposed to hard cvd outcomes.91 95 one analysis of the mesa cohort focusing exclusively on intermediate risk people also reported only soft chd and cvd outcomes.75 in general study cohorts were sufficiently large adequate number of outcome events accrued nontraditional risk factors for cvd 19 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc and representative of the general population for whom cvd risk assessment would be applicable. analyzed cohorts range from approximately 1 000 to 11 000 people the abi collaboration ipd meta analysis includes over 44 000 individuals. studies have a median of at least 5 years of followup except the nijmegen biomedical study n 1 242 which has both short followup 3.8 years and fewer than 100 outcome events observed.95 cohorts include a mix of men and women with a mean age ranging from 53.7 to 73.5 years. the aric cohort analysis excluded individuals with known diabetes.79 only mesa aric and the health aging and body composition study health abc all conducted in the united states reported any racial ethnic diversity.79 81 90 all of the cohorts except nijmegen and aric included diabetes as a variable in the risk prediction model.95 only mesa and aric included race ethnicity as a variable in the risk prediction model.79 90 in the most recent analyses from the mesa cohort people already taking statins approximately a quarter of the population were removed from the analysis.90 most studies reported excluding or are assumed to have excluded people with missing data e.g. for abi or other cvd risk factors . five studies handled abi as a categorical variable in the model four studies handled abi continuously and one study evaluated abi both categorically and continuously. when abi was handled categorically a threshold of 0.9 was considered abnormal. treatment of continuous risk predictors as dichotomous or categorical variables results in loss of statistical power. however because abi has a well established cut point in clinical practice treating it as a categorical variable is a pragmatic approach preserving the continuous form including more complex nonlinear relations addresses a more explanatory question.126 most studies were fair quality. limitations of included studies are described above. fair quality as opposed to good quality studies had less than 10 years of followup to predict 10 year chd or cvd risk had fewer than 20 outcome events per variable did not report any calibration or goodness of fit measures and or did not report confidence intervals or statistical significance of changes in measures of discrimination or risk reclassification additionally published coefficient models did not conduct recalibration. the ipd meta analysis by the abi collaboration was a well conducted analysis and represents the best evidence to address this key question however it was rated as fair quality because many of the cohorts had less than 10 years of followup and the model was not recalibrated to the population analyzed which may result in overly optimistic results. model performance calibration discrimination risk reclassification for model performance we will first discuss results of calibration then discrimination and finally risk reclassification. of the 10 studies 22 cohorts included 5 articles 20 cohorts reported some measure of calibration all articles and cohorts reported discrimination and 9 articles 22 cohorts reported risk reclassification table 9 . to guide the reader each section is formatted similarly with a discussion of results from models using the published coefficients first then model development studies. because this body of evidence includes a single large ipd meta analysis from the abi collaboration which includes 18 different cohorts we discuss findings from the abi collaboration as the central piece of evidence and discuss other studies of individual cohorts in relation to the abi collaboration findings if these studies provide nontraditional risk factors for cvd 20 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc additional insight. calibration in general we have very limited information to assess the change in calibration from the addition of abi to a base model consisting of the frs or pce or a model using similar traditional risk factors table 14 . none of the included studies reported graphical measures of calibration. five of the 10 studies reported the hosmer lemeshow test or measures of overall performance which are integrated measures of both calibration and discrimination.66 95 none of the included studies reported the o e ratio or provided sufficient data for us to calculate the change in o e ratio. from limited reported data on calibration it appears abi can improve upon the calibration of the frs. the only study using the pce as the base model did not report on calibration.90 published coefficient models. the abi collaboration which used published coefficients reported the overall performance measures of r2 akaike information criterion aic and bayes information criterion bic . all three measures suggest that the abi can improve the overall performance of the frs in both men and women table 14 . reductions in aic greater than 10 indicate important differences in model fit 84 however the clinical importance of these changes is uncertain. the regicor study not included in the abi collaboration which also used published coefficients of the frs only reported the aic and found improvements in all participants sex specific analyses not reported to predict both soft chd and cvd outcomes in contrast to hard chd outcomes in the abi collaboration. model development. three model development studies one cohort of which was not included in the abi collaboration reported some measure of calibration or overall performance. the nijmegen biomedical study not included in the abi collaboration had a total of only 71 soft cvd events over an average of 3.8 years.95 while the hosmer lemeshow test suggests a decrement in calibration by adding the abi to frs variables in women this is likely a result of sparse data bias.127 in addition the r2 statistic for this same comparison in women suggests an improvement in calibration and discrimination with the addition of abi to a base model including frs variables. overall the bic and hosmer lemeshow test in the health abc study do not suggest an improvement with the addition of abi to an frs base model to predict hard chd outcomes. the rotterdam study conducted sex specific analyses and demonstrated that while the addition of abi to a base model of frs variables improved the overall model performance for predicting hard chd outcomes as measured by the likelihood ratio test this appears to be true for men but not women. since this is an integrated measure we cannot determine whether calibration discrimination or both are improved in the absence of other measures which are not reported. discrimination all of the included studies reported measures of discrimination i.e. auc c statistic by adding abi to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment table 15 . only one study evaluated the addition of abi to the pce and this study did not show improved discrimination 90 however this cohort excluded people already taking statins and over 80 percent of the population had 10 year hard cvd risk of 7.5 percent or less. additionally this analysis recalibrated the pce to the nontraditional risk factors for cvd 21 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc mesa population which would render a conservative estimate of change in discrimination in the extended model. the ipd meta analysis by the abi collaboration demonstrated that improvement in discrimination with the addition of abi was higher for women than for men. this difference between men and women is likely due to the poorer performance of the frs in women compared to men. studies in cohorts not represented in the ipd meta analyses mostly do not present sex stratified analyses. in the one study not included in the abi collaboration that reported sex stratified analyses the nijmegen biomedical cohort findings of improvement in discrimination for women were not statistically significant likely owing to lack of power. published coefficient models. the abi collaboration which used published coefficients for the frs presented only sex stratified analyses and the base model discrimination was lower in women 0.578 than in men 0.672 .66 this study demonstrated a large improvement in discrimination with the addition of abi in women but not men to predict hard chd outcomes 0.112 although statistical significance is not reported the 95 ci of the base model does not include the point estimate of the extended model however 95 ci of base and extended models do overlap . mesa regicor and heinz nixdorf recall did not report discrimination separately for men and women the overall change in discrimination in these three studies was very small 0.006 to 0.01 with borderline or no statistical significance.90 91 114 one study conducted in the mesa cohort reported a base model discrimination of 0.74 for both the pce and frs. this study demonstrated a very small improvement in discrimination with the addition of abi to the frs to predict hard chd outcomes 0.010 p 0.042 in contrast results were not statistically significant with the addition of abi to the pce to predict hard cvd outcomes 0.010 p 0.55 . in one study regicor the base model discrimination for the frs was good 0.787 for soft cvd 0.795 for soft chd such that there was only very small improvement in discrimination with the addition of abi to predict soft cvd 0.008 p 0.049 but not soft chd outcomes. model development. the abi collaboration also conducted model development analyses. for these sex stratified analyses the discrimination for the base model was higher than analyses using published coefficients and higher in women 0.788 than in men 0.683 . in these analyses the incremental benefit of adding abi to frs variables to predict hard chd outcomes is very small 0.003 for women and 0.007 for men although statistical significance is not reported the 95 ci of the base model includes the point estimates for the extended models. results from individual model development studies of cohorts included in the abi collaboration aric eas rotterdam and health abc were consistent with the abi collaboration s findings of very small to small improvements in discrimination.79 82 the nijmegen biomedical study not included in the abi collaboration had both limited followup and a limited number of soft cvd events.95 sex stratified analyses showed lower base model discrimination in women 0.691 than in men 0.748 . this study reported a small but not statistically significant improvement in discrimination in women 0.036 p 0.26 but not men data nr . an analysis of the mesa cohort also not included in the abi collaboration and restricted to intermediate risk people 5 20 10 year risk of soft cvd outcomes found a small improvement 0.027 p 0.01 . risk reclassification all but one of the included studies reported nri plus or minus idi table 16 appendix e nontraditional risk factors for cvd 22 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc table 1 . studies used different definitions of low intermediate and high chd or cvd risk categories and one study reported a continuous nri.114 overall and based primarily on the abi collaboration ipd meta analysis the addition of the abi to the frs can improve reclassification nri are at best less than 0.1 and are usually much smaller and often nonsignificant. consistent with findings on changes in discrimination the effect of abi on reclassification appears to be larger for women than men. however the nonevent nri in women was negative suggesting incorrect upward reclassification of risk in women who did not have a chd event. considering that the vast majority of women did not have events 92.9 the overall nri measure may overstate the improvement in reclassification.67 based on data from a single cohort mesa using a pce base model abi does not appear to result in statistically significant change in reclassification to detect hard cvd outcomes in people not already taking statins. four studies including the abi collaboration allow for bias corrected calculation of nri for the intermediate risk group. the most promising results appear to be for adding abi in women at intermediate risk for developing hard chd events 10 19 over 10 years . published coefficient models. the abi collaboration using published coefficients for the frs demonstrated an improvement in reclassification with the addition of abi in women to predict hard chd outcomes but not in men as confidence intervals included 0. the abi collaboration used 10 year risk thresholds of 10 percent for low 10 19 percent for intermediate and 20 percent for high risk of hard chd outcomes. nri for abi in addition to the frs in women was 0.096 95 ci 0.061 to 0.164 and the bias corrected nriint in women was 0.288 95 ci 0.064 to 0.513 . the overall nri is largely driven by reclassification upward of those having events event nri 0.145 95 ci 0.101 to 0.189 but this represents the minority of the population as only 7.1 percent of women experienced a hard chd event. of note the nonevent nri was negative and statistically significant 0.051 95 ci 0.059 to 0.043 . mesa regicor and heinz nixdorf recall not included in the abi collaboration did not report sex stratified analyses. mesa employing published coefficients found no change in nri when abi was added to the frs in analyses employing the same risk categories as the abi collaboration and no change in nri when abi was added to the pce in analyses using a threshold of 7.5 10 year risk for hard cvd outcomes. regicor using published coefficients for the frs employed categories of low 5 intermediate 5 10 and high 10 10 year risk for either soft chd or cvd outcomes. nri for soft cvd outcomes was 0.029 95 ci 0.014 to 0.045 in all people and the bias corrected nriint was 0.061 95 ci 0.024 to 0.098 nri for soft chd outcomes was not statistically significant. regicor also reported idi as a measure of reclassification for adding abi the magnitude and statistical significance of improvement was generally consistent with findings using nri appendix e table 1 . analyses of the heinz nixdorf recall cohort using a published coefficient frs base model found a statistically significant improvement in nri when abi was added to the model however a continuous nri was reported which is not comparable in scale to categorical nris reported in other studies 0.190 95 ci 0.102 to 0.278 .114 subgroup analyses by risk group showed statistically significant nri only in the intermediate 10 20 10 year risk and high 20 10 year risk risk groups. model development. the abi collaboration also conducted model development analyses in these analyses adding abi to frs variables did not improve risk reclassification in men or women. we were not able to calculate bias corrected nriint however uncorrected nriint were nontraditional risk factors for cvd 23 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc not statistically significant. results from individual model development studies of cohorts included in the abi collaboration aric rotterdam and health abc did not report sex stratified analyses and found no statistically significant risk reclassification with the addition of abi to frs variables to predict hard chd or cvd outcomes. the nijmegen biomedical study found an improvement in reclassification nri 0.159 p 0.056 for women but not men for soft and not hard cvd outcomes. this study was not included in the abi collaboration but used similar risk categories followup and number of events were limited. the nijmegen biomedical study also reported idi as a measure of reclassification the idi for addition of abi to frs variables in women was not statistically significant appendix e table 1 . an analysis of the mesa cohort also not included in the abi collaboration demonstrated an improvement in reclassification with abi for intermediate risk people 5 20 10 year risk of soft cvd outcomes . however this study did not report bias corrected nriint and data were not sufficient to calculate nor statistical significance. detailed results for hscrp description of cohorts we included 25 unique studies including one ipd meta analysis that examined whether hscrp added to traditional cvd risk assessment could improve calibration discrimination or risk reclassification tables 17 and 18 .65 75 76 78 81 85 87 90 92 96 100 102 105 107 110 these 26 studies include data from 49 different cohorts and the included ipd meta analysis65 includes 38 of the 49 cohorts table 17 . the 11 cohorts not represented in the ipd meta analysis are the british regional heart study 102 eisner 99 the framingham heart study original cohort 85 health abc 81 heinz nixdorf recall 103 inter99 92 monitoring of trends and determinants in cardiovascular disease monica copenhagen 96 the northwick park heart study 78 the scottish health survey 105 the study of health in pomerania 100 and the singapore chinese health study.109 in total 28 models were evaluated table 19 . six studies evaluated seven models using published coefficients for the pce or frs. twenty studies reported the results of 21 newly developed models based on frs variables 2 of these models additionally included race ethnicity as a predictor.75 110 fifteen models predicted cvd outcomes and 13 predicted chd. seventeen models predicted hard outcomes cvd or chd 10 models predicted soft outcomes cvd or chd and 1 model predicted fatal cvd outcomes only. in general study cohorts were sufficiently large with an adequate number of outcome events accrued and reflective of the general population for whom cvd risk assessment would be applicable. analyzed cohorts ranged from approximately 1 000 to nearly 27 000 participants the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis included 166 596 individuals. most populations were from prospective population based cohort studies including one case cohort analysis110 and three nested case control analyses.87 104 109 additionally five populations consisted of randomized control trial participants these trials evaluated cac screening an included study for kq1 99 lifestyle modification for cvd risk reduction 92 statins 98 108 and aspirin.83 the cohort from the eisner rct with just 4.1 years of followup modeled a predicted time horizon of 4 years though only 35 events accrued.99 otherwise cohorts reported nontraditional risk factors for cvd 24 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc about 100 events at minimum and the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis reported 13 568 hard cvd events and 8 816 hard chd events.65 of the 25 studies 4 were analyses of men only 78 84 98 102 and 2 were exclusively in women.83 97 mean ages ranged from 45.5 to 75.4 years. three studies excluded participants with diabetes 75 83 109 diabetes status was not included as a variable in the respective risk prediction models nor was it in the reykjavik case control analysis where a very small proportion of participants had diabetes 2.3 .87 the proportion of participants with diabetes in other studies ranged from 1.9 to 13.3 percent where reported and diabetes was included as a predictor in these models. mesa aric and health abc all conducted in the united states reported racial ethnic diversity of which analyses for mesa and aric included race ethnicity as a variable in their risk prediction model.75 81 90 110 the analysis by salim and colleagues109 was conducted in a cohort of exclusively chinese adults in singapore. three studies excluded participants taking statins at baseline 90 104 108 and where reported statin use ranged from 3 to 14 percent in other studies. use of antihypertensive agents was relatively common in studies reporting it generally about 12 to 32 percent. aspirin use was reported in only health abc a study of adults age 70 or older which reported that 18.8 percent of this primary prevention population was taking the drug. mean baseline framingham risk scores were sparsely reported and the distribution of risk among low intermediate and high risk classifications varied widely between studies. comparisons of baseline risk across cohorts are limited by different predicted outcomes and variable followup time but generally suggest heterogeneity. for example 6.2 percent of the mesa cohort experienced a hard cvd event over 10 years of followup 90 whereas the hard cvd event rate was nearly twice as high in the british regional heart study of exclusively men 13.9 over 9 years of followup .102 ten of 26 studies explicitly indicated that a high sensitivity crp assay was used however others reported low limits of detection consistent with hscrp. where reported the threshold defining an elevated hscrp was 3.0 mg l and in one case it was 2.0 mg l.87 in studies reporting the proportion of participants with an elevated hscrp about 22 to 52 percent of participants met the studies respective definitions. mean hscrp levels ranged from 1.69 to 5.0 mg l and median hscrp levels ranged from 0.9 to 2.3 mg l. most studies excluded or are assumed to have excluded people with missing data for hscrp or traditional cardiovascular risk factors two analyses both from the rotterdam cohort used imputation.76 82 hscrp was most commonly log transformed when included in risk prediction models owing to its frequently skewed distribution. when entered categorically in risk prediction models as it was in five studies thresholds were typically defined as less than 1 mg l 1 to 3 mg l and greater than 3 mg l. treatment of continuous risk predictors as dichotomous or categorical variables results in loss of statistical power and compromises predictive performance.63 however the threshold of 2 mg l has been used in a large randomized trial of statin therapy in participants with elevated hscrp but normal ldl levels 120 thus use of a categorical form may address a more explanatory question although most included risk prediction studies used a threshold of 3 mg l when categorical analyses were used. most studies were fair quality. limitations of studies are described above. fair quality as nontraditional risk factors for cvd 25 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc opposed to good quality studies had followup time equivalent to the time horizon predicted by the model had fewer than 20 outcome events per variable did not report any calibration or goodness of fit measures and or did not report confidence intervals or statistical significance of changes in measures of discrimination or risk reclassification additionally published coefficient models did not conduct any recalibration. just two studies evaluating hscrp had these characteristics and were therefore assessed as good quality.81 96 the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis was a well conducted model development study and represents the best evidence to address this key question however it was deemed fair quality because calibration a key domain of model performance was not reported.65 additionally many of the included cohorts had less than 10 year followup although reclassification analyses were limited to studies reporting this duration . the emerging risk factors collaboration model has limited applicability because it is not publicly available as a calculator for clinical practice. model performance calibration discrimination risk reclassification for model performance we will first discuss results of calibration then discrimination and finally risk reclassification. of the 25 studies 49 cohorts included 9 articles 10 cohorts reported some measure of calibration all articles and cohorts reported discrimination and 15 articles 33 cohorts reported risk reclassification. to guide the reader each section is formatted similarly with a discussion of results from models using the published coefficients first then model development studies. because this body of evidence includes a single large ipd meta analysis by the emerging risk factors collaboration which comprises 38 different cohorts we discuss findings from the emerging risk factors collaboration as the central piece of evidence and discuss other studies of individual cohorts in relation to these ipd meta analyses findings if these studies provide additional information insight. calibration limited evidence from three published coefficient models each reporting different measures suggests that the addition of hscrp to traditional cardiovascular risk factors can improve calibration table 20 . however calibration plots and o e ratios are not available for these studies. more evidence is available for model development studies although better calibration would be expected in these models because measures are evaluated in the same population from which the model was derived. calibration plots are available for a small subset of model development studies and show that the addition of hscrp can improve model fit in some risk groups but may worsen it in others. based on the included studies and limited reporting around calibration we cannot determine when hscrp improves calibration in some risk groups but not others. various measures generally show improvement when models are extended to include hscrp with some exceptions. the health abc cohort of older adults showed a decrement in most measures of model fit with the addition of hscrp to the model. calibration measures are not reported in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis. no studies evaluating the extension of hscrp to a pce base model or a model including race ethnicity reported any measure of calibration. published coefficient models. three published coefficient models reported measures of calibration or overall performance table 20 .84 96 104 overall performance measures suggested nontraditional risk factors for cvd 26 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc smaller i.e. improved differences between observed and predicted outcomes when hscrp was added to the model but these measures capture both calibration and discrimination. the hosmer lemeshow test which addresses calibration more directly was reported in just one published coefficient analysis. in this nested case control analysis of the epic norfolk study calibration appeared to improve with the addition of hscrp to the model as evaluated by an increase in p value and decrease in test value when assessed in the subset of intermediate risk participants but the addition of hscrp resulted in poorer fit when assessed in all analyzed participants. however the base model itself signaled poor fit p 0.02 the p value for the extended model was 0.009. results of the hosmer lemeshow test are sensitive to how populations are grouped for analysis so comparison of overall results to those of the intermediate risk subset should be interpreted with caution. additionally the higher p value in the intermediate group could occur because of a smaller sample so it is not possible to determine whether apparent improvement is consistent with the whole cohort. model development studies. two model development studies reporting results from three cohorts presented calibration plots and one reported the o e ratio table 20 .78 83 shah and colleagues78 reported calibration plots and the o e ratio by quintile of risk for their analyses of the northwick park heart study ii nphsii and the edinburgh artery study eas that had 162 and 147 events respectively. for nphsii the addition of hscrp to framingham variables worsened the o e ratio i.e. moved away from 1 for the lower three quintiles of risk and improved i.e. got closer to 1 for the higher two quintiles of risk. results showed a similar pattern for the eas analysis but the o e ratio improved for only the highest risk quintile and in this group the base model was already well calibrated. for both base and extended models there was not a consistent trend of over or underprediction across the two studies overprediction occurred in the middle risk quintiles in nphsii and in the lowest risk quintile in eas. however the small number of events in these studies substantially limits the reliability of such an assessment particularly in low risk strata in which very few events occur. for most risk quintiles base models were reasonably well calibrated which is consistent with this being a model development study in which model performance is being evaluated in the same population from which it was derived. a calibration plot is also reported for the women s health study whs model development study that shows predicted and observed risks for 2 percentage point increments in predicted 10 year risk of soft cvd outcomes o e ratios are not reported.83 visual inspection of the calibration plots shows that predicted and observed risk is reasonably concordant for low and high risk levels but less concordant for intermediate risk women 12 to 18 with predicted risk being higher than observed risk. within this intermediate risk group the addition of hscrp to the whs model had little impact for the 12 to 13 percent risk increment markedly improved calibration in the 14 to 15 percent risk increment and worsened in calibration in the 16 to 17 percent risk increment. in the whs analysis the hosmer lemeshow test r2 and brier score all showed improvement in model fit when hscrp was added to base models. in most studies overall performance measures generally suggested improvement when hscrp was added to models.78 81 83 108 the calibration specific hosmer lemeshow test suggested that the addition of hscrp to the base model of traditional cardiovascular disease risk factors nontraditional risk factors for cvd 27 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc worsened model fit in the health abc study the aic and bic measures of overall performance were consistent with this finding.81 of note multivariate adjusted associations of hscrp with soft chd events were not statistically significant in this study. the health abc cohort is an intermediate to high risk cohort with a mean frs of 16.6 percent and average age of over 73. hosmer lemeshow test results in other studies were mixed. in analyses by shah and colleagues 78 the hosmer lemeshow test showed no change in the eas with the addition of hscrp to the base model and a small improvement in the nphsii. discrimination all of the included studies reported change in discrimination i.e. auc or c statistic by adding hscrp to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment table 21 . the discrimination of base models using traditional cardiovascular risk factors ranged widely in both published coefficient models and model development studies from 0.58 to 0.898 collectively. the addition of hscrp to published coefficient models showed mixed results ranging from no change in discrimination in recalibrated models evaluating the pce and frs to small improvement in discrimination 0.03 although higher estimates likely represent an upper bound owing to study design limitations. for model development studies the most expansive evidence comes from the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis which found very small but statistically significant improvement in discrimination for hard cvd 0.0039 and for hard chd 0.0051 interaction testing in exploratory analyses provides some evidence that men achieve a greater predictive improvement than women but these changes are nonetheless very small. evidence from the nine model development studies of cohorts not included in the ipd meta analysis were also inconsistent although comparisons are limited by sparse reporting of statistical significance and confidence intervals. at best improvement in discrimination from the addition of hscrp to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment is small and more likely to occur in the context of a poorly discriminating base model but the clinical meaning of these small changes in discrimination is unknown. published coefficient models. the one published coefficient model evaluating the addition of hscrp to the pce had a base model discrimination of 0.74.90 base model discrimination in published coefficient models for the frs ranged from 0.59 to 0.777.105 the one published coefficient model evaluating the addition of hscrp to the pce in the multiethnic mesa cohort showed no change in discrimination when hscrp was added this model was recalibrated to the local population.90 similarly when hscrp was added to a recalibrated frs base model in the mesa population no change in discrimination was detected. of note participants taking statins were excluded in this analysis therefore about 95 percent of the population was at low risk defined as 10 year chd risk of 10 percent or less. in other studies using a published coefficient frs as a base model the change in c statistic showed mixed results. the largest improvements occurred in the epic norfolk case control analysis 0.03 95 ci 0.01 to 0.05 104 and monica augsburg 0.027 p 0.0077 .84 because of study design considerations these could be considered upper bounds of change in discrimination. the case control design of the epic norfolk analysis likely reduced the base model c statistics because of reduced variation from the process and matching for sex and age and thus likely overstated the change from the addition of hscrp to the model.128 the monica augsburg analysis entered the frs categorically instead of continuously in prediction models which will underestimate the nontraditional risk factors for cvd 28 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc prognostic value of the frs and overestimate the value of hscrp. 63 the monica copenhagen analysis showed a very small but statistically significant improvement in discrimination of 0.012 p 0.037 in men but improvement was not statistically significant in women 0.007 p 0.262 .96 an analysis of only women from the framingham offspring study showed similar results.97 an analysis from the scottish health survey showed that the addition of hscrp to published coefficient frs base models resulted in very small improvements in discrimination for all outcomes evaluated ranging from 0.002 to 0.004 but neither statistical significance nor confidence intervals were reported. two studies reported discrimination for intermediate risk subgroups both defined by 10 year chd risk of 10 to 20 percent.97 104 in both studies the statistical significance of results in intermediate risk groups were concordant with that of the overall population in the study i.e. significant for epic norfolk in the context of a poorly discriminating base model and not significant in women from the framingham offspring cohort but showed a markedly larger change in c statistic. model development studies. similar to published coefficient models base model discrimination in model development studies showed a wide range. in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis which involved 166 596 participants and 13 568 hard cvd events base model discrimination was 0.714.65 in other model development studies discrimination ranged from 0.58 to 0.863 in models predicting hard chd or hard cvd. in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis models the addition of hscrp to the base model increased discrimination by 0.0039 95 ci 0.0028 to 0.0050 for hard cvd and by 0.0051 95 ci 0.0035 to 0.0066 for hard chd. exploratory subgroup analyses suggest effect modification by sex where the improvement in discrimination of hscrp is greater in men than women. this analysis showed a very small statistically significant improvement in men and no change in women the p value for heterogeneity was less than 0.001. analyses by diabetes status suggested no effect modification and analyses by 10 year risk for cvd suggested that the intermediate risk group defined as 10 20 10 year risk may have a larger change in the c statistic when compared with the low risk group less than 10 10 year risk but confidence intervals overlapped. of the 11 cohorts not represented in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis 9 were model development studies.78 81 85 92 99 100 102 103 109 changes in discrimination in these studies ranged from 0.008 for a model predicting hard chd in the health abc study of older adults81 to 0.04 for hard chd in the northwick park heart study which exclusively recruited men.78 statistical significance or confidence intervals were rarely reported when they were no improvements in discrimination were statistically significant. concordant with findings from the ipd meta analysis a nested case control study from the singapore chinese health study suggested that the improvement in discrimination from the addition of hscrp to risk prediction models was larger in men but still very small than women 0.01 vs 0.002 however confidence intervals for change in c statistic were not reported.109 the base model had poorer initial discrimination in men than women 0.679 vs 0.778 allowing for more opportunity for improvement. yeboah and colleagues75 evaluated a subset of intermediate risk participants from mesa defined as those between 5 and 20 10 year chd risk and found a very small statistically significant improvement in discrimination for both soft cvd and soft chd nontraditional risk factors for cvd 29 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc outcomes 0.017 p 0.03 base model discrimination was 0.623. risk reclassification fifteen of 25 studies evaluated reclassification from hscrp when added to traditional cardiovascular risk factors encompassing data from 33 cohorts 22 of which were represented in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis table 22 . one study addressed the addition of hscrp to a recalibrated pce which used a risk threshold of 7.5 percent or greater 10 year risk for hard cvd this study showed no statistically significant reclassification. in frs based models low risk was typically defined as less than 10 percent 10 year risk for a cvd or chd event although was sometimes defined as less than 6 percent. intermediate risk was generally defined as 10 to 15 percent or 10 to 20 percent 10 year risk although it sometimes had a lower bound of 6 percent. high risk was usually defined as greater than 20 percent 10 year risk and sometimes greater than 15 percent. the one pce based analysis used a risk threshold of 7.5 percent or greater 1 year risk for a hard cvd event. findings for nri were somewhat inconsistent. the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis represents the most expansive evidence and showed an nri no greater than 0.02. the ipd meta analysis and several smaller studies suggest that improvement in risk reclassification occurs in men but not women and is driven by improvement in those having events being reclassified to higher risk categories. when a bias corrected nriint could be calculated nriint were usually slightly higher than the nri for overall population and statistical significance was sometimes maintained. published coefficient models. three published coefficient studies evaluating four models offer inconsistent evidence about the added value of hscrp to improve reclassification of risk compared to the frs or pce. the published coefficient analyses of recalibrated pce and frs models by yeboah and colleagues90 showed no statistically significant improvement in nri for either model pce 0.024 95 ci 0.015 to 0.067 frs 0.003 95 ci 0.028 to 0.026 . we calculated a bias corrected nriint for the frs intermediate risk group which similarly showed no significant improvement. similar to findings for discrimination outcomes in monica copenhagen men achieved a statistically significant improvement in continuous nri whereas women did not men 0.308 95 ci 0.081 to 0.534 women 0.083 95 ci 0.354 to 0.189 .96 continuous nri should not be directly compared to nri using defined risk strata. the case control analysis of the epic norfolk study suggests that hscrp can reclassify individuals nri 0.120 but did not report statistical significance or confidence intervals.104 idi was reported only in the monica copenhagen analysis and the sex specific findings of improvement in men but not women were consistent appendix e table 2 . while two studies using published coefficients report nri for individuals at intermediate risk for chd or cvd events one study did not allow for calculation of a bias corrected nriint and did not report statistical significance 104 and the other study found nonstatistically significant results. however this study had only 27 hard chd events in the intermediate risk group.90 model development. the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis calculated nri in 22 of 38 included cohorts that had 10 or more years of followup and that reported data for both fatal and nonfatal cvd events.65 the overall nri was 0.0152 95 ci 0.0078 to 0.0227 and was driven by improvement in event nri 0.0146 95 ci 0.0073 to 0.0219 . sex specific nontraditional risk factors for cvd 30 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc analyses were conducted in 15 studies that included both men and women and provide some confirmatory evidence for the monica copenhagen published coefficient study showing that the benefit in risk reclassification from the addition of hscrp accrues in men but not in women. in the ipd meta analysis the nri for men was 0.0124 95 ci 0.0020 to 0.0269 and for women was 0.0036 95 ci 0.0070 to 0.0142 neither result was statistically significant and subgroup analyses were exploratory no formal interaction testing was reported . additional reclassification data are available from nine model development studies in cohorts not analyzed in the emerging risk factors collaboration analyses of nri cohorts included in ipd ma analyses of reclassification are a subset of included cohorts restricted to those with greater than 10 years of followup and recording both fatal and nonfatal events .75 78 92 98 100 102 103 107 109 overall these studies had mixed findings. the smallest nri of 0.010 95 ci 0.002 to 0.018 was from a two category analysis with a risk threshold of 20 percent or greater reported in a primary prevention subgroup of exclusively men from a statin rct.98 the largest reclassification nri 0.1177 95 ci 0.030 to 0.205 was seen in an analysis of the framingham offspring cohort of which 82.5 percent of the population were low risk defined as less than 6 10 year risk .107 the health abc cohort of older adults evaluated the additional predictive value of hscrp added to traditional risk factors but reclassification was not reported because hscrp was not statistically significantly associated with soft chd events after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors.81 the case control analysis from the singapore chinese health study is concordant with findings from the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis in that event nri was substantially larger than nonevent nri and that reclassification improved significantly in men but not women.109 one study nhpsii had a statistically significant negative nonevent nri 0.008 95 ci 0.014 to 0.001 meaning that more participants not having events were reclassified inappropriately upward this analysis is based on a 10 year risk threshold of 15 percent.78 we explored whether results varied by predicted outcome definitions of risk strata or case mix. these variables did not appear to explain differences in across studies however such comparisons are limited by several concurrent sources of heterogeneity. four model development studies reported idi appendix e table 2 . the idi was statistically significant in 2 of 4 studies and where significant was no greater than 0.02. nriint is available in six model development studies including the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis. in the ipd meta analysis a bias corrected nriint was slightly larger than for the overall population and retained statistical significance nriint 0.027 95 ci 0.007 to 0.047 and nri 0.0152 95 ci 0.0078 to 0.0227 .65 other model development studies where a bias correction could be performed showed larger nriint than in the emerging risk factors collaboration ipd meta analysis and larger reclassification when evaluated to the overall population in each respective study nriint for hard events ranged from 0.076 to 0.130.78 102 107 statistical significance was only maintained in some studies likely due to greatly reduced power when evaluating a smaller subset of participants. the nriint in the rotterdam study could not be bias corrected based on reported information. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 31 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc detailed results for cac description of cohorts we included 19 unique studies that examined whether cac added to traditional cvd risk assessment could improve calibration discrimination or risk reclassification table 23 . these studies include data from 10 different cohorts. in total 24 different models were evaluated table 24 . six studies evaluated eight different models using published coefficients for the pce or frs. thirteen studies reported the results of newly developed models based on frs variables three studies using the mesa cohort evaluated models which included race ethnicity as a predictor77 101 113 and two studies reported the results of newly developed models based on pce variables. ten models predicted cvd outcomes and 17 predicted chd. sixteen models predicted hard outcomes cvd or chd 7 models predicted soft outcomes cvd or chd and 1 model predicted only fatal cvd outcomes. study cohorts were generally smaller than those contributing to the abi and hscrp evidence base and no ipd meta analysis was available. analyzed cohorts ranged from 946 to 7 772 participants. seven of the cohorts represented were prospective population based cohorts mesa heinz nixdorf recall framingham offspring study framingham 3rd generation dallas heart study rotterdam south bay heart watch and the other three were derived from randomized control trial participants eisner or selective samples of asymptomatic people getting a cac scan houston methodist debakey heart and vascular center cardiac research database . with the exception of analyses from the mesa cohort 90 113 heinz nixdorf recall 114 and a pooled analysis of five cohorts of low risk women 111 all studies had less than 10 years of followup. with the exception of the mesa rotterdam and heinz nixdorf recall cohorts studies had fewer than 100 hard chd or cvd events. the studies using a cohort from the eisner rct had a very limited number of events 35 soft cvd events and 47 soft cvd events eisner rct supplemented by a cardiac research database . studies included a mix of both men and women with a mean age ranging from 50 to 69.5 years. only two cohorts south bay heart watch mesa reported including any non white participants. two studies south bay heart watch 86 mesa77 explicitly excluded participants with diabetes. one study using the mesa cohort included only participants with diabetes.94 all but three of the models included diabetes as a variable in the risk prediction model if individuals with diabetes were included in the cohorts.74 101 106 in one analysis from the mesa cohort people already taking statins approximately a quarter of the population were removed from the analysis therefore about 81 percent of the included participants had a less than 7.5 percent 10 year risk for a hard cvd event.90 otherwise when reported cohorts typically included a more even distribution of chd cvd risk but notably a 2016 analysis by kavousi and colleagues pooled low risk women from 5 population based cohorts.111 differences in definitions of risk strata and type of chd or cvd event being predicted limits direct comparison across studies and cohorts. we did not include studies in which the cac score was derived from ct angiography. in the included studies there was some variation in how cac scores were obtained. studies either used electron beam or multidetector ct ebct or multidetector computer tomography mdct with varying protocols. in some instances in which ebct is used the protocol specified electrocardiograph ecg gated ebct. estimated radiation exposure from ct imaging is nontraditional risk factors for cvd 32 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc discussed in the harms of screening section kq3 . a cac score also referred to as agatston score is calculated based on a person s age sex and sum of coronary artery calcification density x volume seen. the cac score is often interpreted categorically for example no coronary calcification score of 0 mild 100 moderate 100 to 399 severe 400 to 999 and extensive 1000 coronary calcification. when reported in the included studies thresholds defining an elevated cac score varied widely from the presence of any cac 0 to thresholds of above 100 and more commonly above 300 or 400. in the convenience sample as opposed to population based cohort the prevalence of abnormal cac scores was higher. for example the prevalence of a cac score of greater than 400 was approximately 25 percent in the houston methodist debakey heart vascular center cohort as compared to approximately 10 percent or less in the heinz nixdorf recall framingham offspring and mesa cohorts. most studies excluded or are assumed to have excluded people with missing data for cac or traditional cardiovascular risk factors some analyses using the rotterdam and mesa plus heinz nixdorf recall cohorts used imputation.76 82 89 94 cac was most commonly log transformed when included in risk prediction models. in four instances cac was entered categorically in risk prediction models with a varying number of strata used with different definitions. all the studies were assessed as fair quality. limitations of studies are described above. fair quality as opposed to good quality studies did not conduct any recalibration in the setting of using published coefficients for pce or frs models had followup time equivalent to the time horizon predicted had fewer than 20 outcome events per variable did not report any calibration or goodness of fit measures and or did not report confidence intervals or statistical significance of changes in measures of discrimination or risk reclassification. model performance calibration discrimination risk reclassification for model performance we will first discuss results of calibration then discrimination and finally risk reclassification. of the 19 studies 10 cohorts included 8 articles 4 cohorts reported some measure of calibration all articles and cohorts reported discrimination and 15 articles 9 cohorts reported risk reclassification. to guide the reader each section is formatted similarly with a discussion of results from models using the published coefficients first then model development studies. calibration limited evidence from four cohorts and primarily model development studies suggests that the addition of cac to the frs can improve calibration however the magnitude and clinical significance of this improvement are not certain table 25 . calibration plots and o e ratios are not available. published coefficient models. one published coefficient analysis using the pce as a base model reported the hosmer lemeshow test and the overall performance measure of the bic for sex and race ethnicity subgroups.112 the hosmer lemeshow test showed no evidence of miscalibration in the extended model for all subgroups except women the publication does not report calibration for the base model. the overall performance measure of the bic which captures both nontraditional risk factors for cvd 33 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc calibration and discrimination suggested improvement which was characterized as very strong for all groups except asians. model development studies. no studies reported calibration plots or o e ratio. only one model development study using the rotterdam cohort reported calibration or overall performance measures for the addition of cac to pce variables.89 overall performance measures i.e. aic likelihood ratio 2 and global 2 consistently showed improvement in performance with the addition of cac to base models.76 82 89 93 however because of the integrated nature of these measures we are unable to draw conclusions about whether calibration discrimination or both improved due to the addition of cac. the one study evaluating a base model of pce variables found no evidence of miscalibration in the base model based on the hosmer lemeshow test and an improvement in calibration with the addition of cac however this study predicted fatal cvd outcomes as opposed to hard cvd outcomes table 25 .89 there were fewer than 100 fatal cvd outcomes in this analysis. three studies two using the heinz nixdorf recall cohort and one using mesa only report the hosmer lemeshow test table 25 .74 77 103 two of the three models suggest improvement in calibration with the addition of cac to the base model however the hosmer lemeshow test is not a sensitive test. discrimination all of the included studies reported the improvement in discrimination as measured by a change in auc or c statistic by adding cac to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment table 26 . the discrimination of base models using traditional cardiovascular risk factors ranged widely in both published coefficient models and model development studies from 0.63 to 0.80 in all participants. the addition of cac to published coefficient models and model development studies consistently resulted in at least small and sometimes large improvements in discrimination. four studies evaluated the addition of cac to the pce. one of these studies using the mesa cohort also evaluated the frs and findings suggest that improvement in discrimination was higher for cac in addition to the frs 0.04 than to the pce 0.02 . published coefficient models. two published coefficient analyses both using the mesa cohort evaluated a pce base model. one is an analysis by yeboah and colleagues 90 which excluded people already taking statins and therefore represents a population at lower risk for cvd the other analysis by fudim and colleagues112 explored the addition of cac in sex and racial ethnic subpopulations and as such results are exclusively reported by subpopulation. the base model discrimination of the pce to predict hard cvd events in the analysis by yeboah and colleagues was 0.74 the addition of cac resulted in an improvement of 0.02 p 0.04 .90 however as this was a model that recalibrated the pce to the mesa population estimates of improvement in discrimination may be conservative. the analysis by fudim and colleagues showed a pce base model discrimination of 0.705 in men and 0.766 in women c statistics varied across racial and ethnic groups with the poorest performance in african americans 0.707 and the best performance in latinos 0.800 . improvements in discrimination were very small to small in all subpopulations but were statistically significant only in men who were the group with the poorest base model performance improvement of 0.025 p 0.047 neither confidence intervals nor statistical significance are reported. subgroup analyses by race ethnicity may not be adequately powered to detect statistically significant differences i.e. smaller n s and number of nontraditional risk factors for cvd 34 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc events for african americans latinos and asians chinese . the mesa analysis by yeboah and colleagues also evaluates the addition of cac to a published coefficient frs base model to predict hard chd events base model discrimination was also 0.74 and the addition of cac resulted in an improvement of 0.04 p 0.001 . in other studies using the frs to predict hard chd the base model discrimination ranged from 0.63 to 0.757.74 86 106 114 in these studies the addition of cac resulted in an improvement in discrimination of 0.038 to 0.102 however results in the analysis of eisner combined with the cardiac research database were not statistically significant due to the limited number of events.106 presumably due to the low number of hard chd events in this cohort this study also conducted analyses with soft chd and soft cvd outcomes in which similar improvements in discrimination were statistically significant. in one study using the heinz nixdorf recall cohort sex stratified analyses suggest a greater improvement in discrimination using cac in addition to the frs for men compared to women owing to the poorer performance of the base model in men compared to women .74 model development studies. two model development studies evaluated the addition of cac to pce variables. one study was a pooled analysis of low risk 7.5 women in five population based cohorts which had a base model discrimination of 0.73 95 ci 0.69 to 0.77 and a very small to small improvement in discrimination with the addition of cac 0.02 95 ci 0.0 to 0.05 .111 the other model development study using the rotterdam cohort evaluated the addition of cac to pce variables used fatal as opposed to hard cvd events.89 this study s base model discrimination was 0.78 95 ci 0.73 to 0.83 and with the addition of cac was 0.81 95 ci 0.76 to 0.86 with overlapping 95 ci in which the ci of the base model includes the point estimate of discrimination of the extended model with cac p value not reported . the remaining 12 model development studies used frs variables in their base model the pooled analysis of low risk women by kavousi and colleagues evaluated the addition of cac to frs variables as well as pce variables. the discrimination in five studies using a base model of frs variables to predict hard chd events in all participants ranged from 0.712 to 0.79.74 76 82 88 103 111 in these studies cac led to small statistically significant improvements in discrimination 0.04 to 0.05 . only one study which used the rotterdam cohort conducted sex stratified analyses and found similar improvements in discrimination in both men and women.82 one study that used mesa included only participants with diabetes while the base model discrimination may be lower difficult to compare across studies as confidence intervals were not reported improvement in discrimination using cac was similar in magnitude.94 three additional studies using a model of frs variables to predict soft chd events generally found similar improvements in discrimination with cac in all participants.77 93 101 the lower base model performance of frs variables in the houston methodist debakey heart and vascular center cohort may have something to do with the more selected higher risk population studied. one of these studies using mesa conducted sensitivity analyses with and without those with diabetes as their base model did not include diabetes as a risk factor both these analyses yielded similar results.101 one additional study using mesa included only intermediate risk people defined as 2.0 to 15.4 percent 7.5 year risk of having a soft chd event this study found the base model discrimination was 0.623 and the improvement in discrimination with cac was 0.161 p 0.001 .75 last results from one study using the eisner rct only reported discrimination using soft cvd events and generally found concordant results.99 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 35 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc risk reclassification most of the included studies k 15 reported risk reclassification using nri with or without idi table 27 . although population risk outcomes predicted and definitions of risk strata vary across studies cac added to traditional cardiovascular risk factors consistently improves risk reclassification as measured by the total nri. four studies evaluated the addition of cac to the pce and these studies demonstrate that cac can improve risk reclassification albeit with some study limitations. cac appears to improve reclassification across a spectrum of risk and in both men and women. improvements in the total nri were consistently driven by event nris much larger than nonevent nris yet nonevents were considerably more common less than about 8 of participants in each included study had a hard event and the total nri is not weighted by event prevalence. it was not uncommon in the cac literature for nonevent nris to be negative sometimes statistically significant indicating than on net more participants were inappropriately reclassified upward. published coefficient models. three studies of two cohorts using published coefficients reported measures of risk reclassification. analyses of a pce base model were restricted to just one cohort mesa.90 again the mesa analysis by yeboah and colleagues excluded people already taking statins and therefore represents a population at lower risk for cvd. for the pce analysis the study defined low risk as having less than 7.5 percent 10 year risk of a hard cvd event and high risk as 7.5 percent or greater risk. this study found an nri of 0.119 95 ci 0.08 to 0.256 with a greater proportion of those having a cvd event vs. not having an event reclassified to higher risk categories with the addition of cac to the pce the nonevent nri was negative but not statistically significant 0.059 95 ci 0.075 to 0.03 . the mesa analysis by fudim and colleagues112 reported statistically significant nri for both men and women 0.080 and 0.095 respectively but event and nonevent nri were not reported and could not be calculated the risk threshold was 5.25 percent 7 year risk which corresponds to 7.5 percent 10 year risk. subgroup analyses by race ethnicity showed that the nri was statistically significant only for whites 0.111 which was also the largest group in the study other nris ranged from 0.121 p 0.11 for asians to 0.111 p 0.082 for african americans. again subgroup analyses by race ethnicity had limited samples and number of events. for the frs analysis by yeboah and colleagues 90 the study defined low risk as less than 10 percent 10 year risk of a hard chd event intermediate risk as 10 to 20 percent risk and high risk as greater than 20 percent risk. this study found an nri 0.084 95 ci 0.024 to 0.196 again with a greater proportion of those having a cvd event reclassified with the addition of cac to the frs again the nonevent nri was negative but not statistically significant. the bias corrected nriint was lower and not statistically significant. an analysis of the heinz nixdorf recall cohort showed a statistically significant nri for all analyzed participants as well as for participants defined as low risk 10 and intermediate risk 10 20 however continuous nris are reported and are not comparable in scale to the categorical nris reported above.114 event and nonevent nris were not reported and the intermediate risk nri was not bias corrected and could not be calculated. model development studies. two model development studies evaluated the addition of cac to pce variables.89 111 an analysis by kavousi and colleagues pooled low risk women 7.5 10 year risk from five population based cohorts and found a statistically significant continuous nri of 0.20 95 ci 0.09 to 0.31 event and nonevent nris were not reported and could not be nontraditional risk factors for cvd 36 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc calculated. the other study in the rotterdam cohort evaluated fatal as opposed to hard cvd events and because there are no accepted risk categories for fatal events this study used continuous nri. this study found an nri 0.55 95 ci 0.33 to 0.76 with a greater proportion of those having a fatal event vs. not having an event reclassified with the addition of cac to pce variables. this nri should not be directly compared to nri using categorical risk strata. the idi is also reported but not discussed further appendix e table 3 . the remaining 11 model development studies used frs variables in their base model the pooled analysis by kavousi and colleagues evaluated the addition of cac to both frs variables and pce variables.111 six studies included analyses using frs variables to predict hard chd events for all participants.74 76 82 88 103 with the exception of the analysis by hoffmann and colleagues which predicted 5 year risk and used four instead of three risk categories these studies used similar risk categorizations with low risk defined as less than 10 percent 10 year risk of a hard chd event intermediate risk as 10 to 20 percent risk and high risk as greater than 20 percent risk. in these studies categorical nri ranged from 0.14 to 0.319 and one study reported a continuous nri of 0.28. for those studies reporting or allowing for calculation of event and nonevent nri a greater proportion of those having a hard chd event versus not having an event were reclassified with the addition of cac to frs variables. in half of these studies the nonevent nri was negative and was statistically significant in two studies 82 88 it was also negative and statistically significant in one study reporting soft chd outcomes.113 the idi reported in two of these studies was congruent with findings using nri as a measure of reclassification appendix e table 3 .74 103 one study which used the rotterdam cohort conducted sex stratified analyses and found greater reclassification in men than women.82 bias corrected nriint was calculated for three of these studies.74 82 88 one of these studies which used the framingham offspring cohort found slightly greater reclassification for the intermediate risk group as compared to all participants.88 the other two studies found a similar magnitude in nri in the intermediate risk group as compared to all participants.74 82 the reasons for the differences in findings among these three studies comparing intermediate versus all risk participants is not clear. three additional studies using frs variables to predict soft chd events generally found similar improvements in reclassification with cac in all participants.77 93 113 these studies use different categorization of risk different from one another and different from studies predicting hard chd events nonetheless nri and idi results in these two studies are similar to findings using hard chd events. one of these studies which used mesa conducted sensitivity analyses with and without individuals with diabetes as their base model did not include diabetes as a risk factor this analysis yielded similar results.77 in two of these studies both which used mesa and in which we could calculate a bias corrected nriint the nriint was smaller than the nri for all participants.77 113 one additional study that used mesa included only intermediate risk people but a bias corrected nriint could not be calculated.75 last results from one study that used the eisner rct included soft cvd events as an outcome presumably to increase power reclassification results were generally concordant to other studies using hard chd or cvd events and results for bias corrected nriint were no longer statistically significant.99 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 37 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc kq3. what are the harms of nontraditional risk factor assessment summary we included eight studies that evaluated the harms of nontraditional risk factor assessment all of which focused on harms of cac 11 88 89 115 119 we found no studies evaluating potential harms of abi or hscrp. four studies reported radiation exposure for ct imaging to obtain cac table 28 and five studies reported other potential adverse events from cac i.e. psychological outcomes adverse cardiovascular events and health care utilization tables 29 31 . we did not find any studies that met our inclusion criteria that reported incidental findings or subsequent testing procedures from incidental finding on ct imaging to obtain cac. overall the radiation exposure or effective radiation dose per ct exam is low 2 msv. based on two studies risk assessment with cac does not appear to cause any short term up to 1 year mental distress. based on two additional studies risk assessment with cac did not appear to paradoxically increase cvd events. studies evaluating the impact of cac on downstream health care utilization have mixed findings. two studies suggest cac for cvd risk assessment is not associated with increased testing from 6 months up to 4 years. one large study using administrative medicare claims data suggest that cac in asymptomatic people was associated with increased use of cardiac tests and procedures compared to people receiving hscrp or lipid screening. it is unclear whether the increase in testing or procedures among those receiving a cac score represents a true harm because there was a trend not statistically significant for improved mi cva and mortality outcomes at a median of 3 years of followup in people who had a cac screen versus those who had hscrp testing there was but no difference in clinical outcomes between people who received cac versus lipid screening alone. detailed results description of studies four studies reported radiation exposure for ct imaging to obtain cac 11 88 89 115 three of which were included studies for kqs 1 and 2 table 28 . these studies report the radiation exposure or effective radiation dose range from obtaining cac in three population based cohorts rotterdam framingham offspring mesa and the eisner rct. two articles that reported ranges of radiation exposure or effective radiation dose from cac using nonsystematic literature reviews were not included but are summarized in the discussion.129 130 there was some variation in how cac scores were obtained across included studies. these four studies each had multiple sites with varying protocols across sites. studies used electron beam or multidetector ct ebct or mdct scanners. only the mesa study explicitly mentioned ecg triggered or gated acquisition of images using ebct and reported how the effective radiation dose was calculated. only two studies explicitly state that they calculated the effective radiation dose 88 115 while the other two studies did not specify effective radiation dose11 89 and generically refer to an estimated radiation dose. the effective dose specifically refers to the tissue weighted sum of equivalent doses. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 38 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc five studies reported other potential adverse events from cac including mental distress adverse cardiovascular events and health care utilization tables 29 31 . one of these studies was the eisner rct included for kq1.11 two studies reported measures of mental distress from cac obtained for cvd risk assessment.118 119 one of these studies n 1 169 was a subsample selected from two centers participating in danrisk a population based cohort in denmark to study cac progression and the incidence of cvd events.118 participants were men and women ages 50 or 60 years. approximately 10 percent of responders were on lipid lowering medications 20 percent were on antihypertensive medications and 25 percent were current smokers. about 8 percent of responders reported taking some type of medication for depression anxiety or other mental health condition. the other study n 450 was a u.s. based rct of cac as a motivational factor in intensive cvd screening versus usual care among people in active military duty.119 participants were ages 39 to 45 years mostly men and about 22 percent were african american. approximately 4 percent of participants were taking statins 6 percent were taking antihypertensive medications and 8 percent were current smokers. about 5 percent of participants reported taking antidepressant medication. both studies used validated scales to measure depression the rct also measured anxiety and overall mental health functioning. the observational study reported depression scores before and 6 months after cac screening in 539 of 591 people offered a depression questionnaire. the rct reported depression anxiety and mental health functioning scores between groups who did and did not receive cac information in 406 of the 450 participants at 1 year of followup. three studies reported adverse cardiovascular outcomes and or health care utilization associated with cac.11 116 117 again one of these studies was the eisner rct included for kq1.11 two observational studies used claims data geographically representative of the entire united states.116 117 one study by chi and colleagues used a research database and identified participants ages 18 to 64 years old who received cac n 2 679 and downstream utilization was analyzed for non high risk people n 2 139 defined as those people without known diabetes or cvd in the 12 months preceding cac. a comparator group n 867 comprised people whose physicians requested cac but were denied because the procedure was not covered by their health plan benefits. subsequent cardiac imaging revascularization and cardiovascular medications were assessed in the 6 months following cac. this study also assessed cvd events with a median followup of about 22 months for the group that received cac and about 17 months for the group that did not receive cac. the other observational study by shreibati and colleagues used medicare data and identified asymptomatic participants who received cac n 4 184 and assessed downstream utilization and clinical outcomes after cac. two reference groups were used for comparison one propensity matched group that received hscrp n 261 356 and one that received lipid screening n 118 093 . subsequent cardiac imaging revascularization and hospitalization were assessed in the180 days following cac as well as clinical cvd outcomes mortality and cost not reported here in the 3 years following cac. in addition to limitations of using claims data both studies have limitations in their assembly of comparator groups although the study by shreibati and colleagues state they used propensity scores to help match controls. the eisner trial randomized middle aged volunteers from a single medical center who had cvd risk factors but no known cvd to receive cac or not. subsequent cardiac imaging revascularization cardiovascular medications and cost not reported here were assessed in the 4 years following randomization. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 39 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc radiation dose the radiation exposure reported ranged from an effective dose of 0.74 to 1.26 msv in the mesa and framingham offspring cohorts88 115 to radiation dose did not specify effective dose of 2.1 msv in the rotterdam and eisner cohorts table 28 .11 89 the radiation exposure was not reported separately for ebct versus mdct. psychological outcomes neither of the two included studies suggested any adverse mental health effects from cac table 29 . the observational study found a statistically significant improvement in depression as measured by the major depression inventory mdi from before cac to 6 months after cac. the clinical meaningfulness of this small change 1.4 p 0.0001 on a scale of 0 to 50 is not clear. a score of 0 to 20 on the mdi indicates no depression the mean before and after scores in this cohort were 5.3 and 3.9 respectively.118 the rct found no statistically significant difference in depression or anxiety as measured by prime md or overall mental health functioning as measured by the sf 36 at 1 year followup between the group that received cac scores versus the group which did not.119 changes in these measures were small and baseline scores in depression anxiety and overall mental health functioning were not reported. cardiovascular outcomes neither of the two included studies suggested any paradoxical increase in adverse cvd events table 30 . both studies used administrative data. one study by chi and colleagues found no difference in mi cva or hospital admission for unstable angina in the 22 months for the group that received cac versus 17 months for the group that did not receive cac.116 the other study by shreibati and colleagues found no statistically significant difference in mi cva or all cause mortality up to a median of 3 years between those who received cac versus those who received hscrp or lipid screening. 117 this study observed a trend but not statistically significant for fewer mi events in the group that received cac versus that which received hscrp. health care utilization three studies that reported health care utilization following cac had mixed findings table 31 . the eisner rct found no statistically significant increase in cardiac imaging or revascularization at up to 4 years after cac screening compared to those who did not receive cac screening.11 people who were randomized to cac screening had a trend for increased nuclear stress testing 12.9 compared to those who did not 10.0 but this increase was not statistically significant p 0.06 . two studies using administrative data evaluated downstream health care utilization following cac. one study found no difference in cardiac imaging or revascularization in people without known diabetes or cvd who received cac versus those who were denied cac.116 however one study using medicare claims data found greater number of subsequent cardiac imaging tests and revascularization in asymptomatic people who received cac compared to people receiving hscrp or lipid screening.117 while the eisner rct had a superior study design the findings may be less applicable to clinical practice. on the other hand whilst the administrative data reflects clinical practice the limitations of administrative data and nontraditional risk factors for cvd 40 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc the assembly of control groups limit our confidence as to how much if any increase in downstream testing may occur following cac in asymptomatic adults for cvd risk prediction. kq4. does treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors in addition to traditional risk factors lead to reduced incidence of cardiovascular events and or mortality summary we did not identify any trials examining nontraditional risk factor assessment in addition to the frs or pce to guide treatment and reduce cardiovascular events. we included four rcts that evaluated whether pharmacologic treatment guided by nontraditional risk factor assessment alone i.e. abi hscrp or cac lead to reduced cvd events and or mortality.120 124 two of these trials evaluated aspirin therapy in individuals with an abnormal abi one trial evaluated statin therapy in people with an abnormal hscrp and one trial evaluated statins in individuals with an abnormal cac. two good quality trials aaa and popadad in asymptomatic adults including one trial exclusively in participants with diabetes with an abnormal abi did not find any statistically significant benefit for low dose aspirin aspirin 100 mg daily on reducing cvd outcomes or all cause mortality compared to placebo after approximately 7 to 8 years of followup. one fair quality trial st. francis heart study in asymptomatic people with ldl 175 mg dl and cac at the 80th percentile or greater for age and gender did not find any statistically significant benefit for moderate intensity statin therapy atorvastatin 20 mg daily on reducing cvd outcomes compared to placebo after about 4 years of followup. however this study had a lower than expected number of events and was terminated early. one good quality trial jupiter in asymptomatic people with ldl 130 mg dl and hscrp of 2.0 or greater mg l found a rather large relative reduction in cvd events for high intensity statin therapy rosuvastatin 20 mg daily compared to placebo hr 0.56 95 ci 0.46 to 0.69 at approximately 2 years terminated early however absolute benefits were small. detailed results description of studies two rcts aspirin for asymptomatic atherosclerosis aaa n 3 350 and prevention of progression of arterial disease and diabetes popadad n 1 276 evaluated the benefit of low dose aspirin in asymptomatic people with abnormal abi tables 32 and 33 .122 123 both trials were conducted in scotland with a mean age of participants of about 60 to 62 years. the aaa trial included a predominance of women 71.5 . the popadad trial was exclusively in people with known diabetes approximately one third of whom were treated with insulin. only 2.6 percent of people in the aaa trial had diabetes. approximately one third of the participants in both trials were identified as current smokers. at baseline 4.2 percent of participants were taking a statin 25 at 5 years in the aaa trial. the popadad trial did not report the proportion taking a statin. neither trial used the conventional 0.90 threshold for an abnormal abi the aaa trial defined an abnormal abi as 0.95 and the popadad trial defined an nontraditional risk factors for cvd 41 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc abnormal abi as 0.99. both trials randomized participants to take aspirin 100 mg daily or placebo the popadad trial used a factorial design to also evaluate a combination antioxidant capsule data not discussed . there was no evidence of an interaction between aspirin and the antioxidants. both trials defined a composite cvd outcome i.e. mi cva revascularization or amputation for critical ischemia as their primary endpoint and were powered to detect a difference in this outcome. average followup was 8.2 years for the aaa trial terminated early due to futility and 6.7 years for the popadad trial. both of these trials were good quality rcts with good baseline comparability intention to treat analyses and minimal loss to followup and were powered for composite cvd outcomes. one rct justification for the use of statins in prevention an intervention trial evaluating rosuvastatin jupiter n 17 802 evaluated the benefit of rosuvastatin 20 mg daily in persons with an elevated hscrp but normal ldl tables 32 and 33 .120 this trial was conducted across 26 countries. the median age of participants was 66 years old approximately 38 percent of whom were women and approximately 25 percent of whom were african american or latino. participants had to have an ldl 130 mg dl. people with known diabetes were excluded from the trial. approximately 16 percent were current smokers and approximately 17 percent of participants were taking aspirin. an abnormal hscrp was defined as 2.0 mg l as opposed to 3.0 mg l which was most often employed in included kq2 studies the median hscrp of participants was 4.2 mg l. half of trial participants had an frs of 10 percent or less. the primary endpoint was a composite cvd outcome that included mi cva hospitalization for unstable angina and or revascularization. this was a good quality trial but terminated early because the stopping boundary was crossed at the first efficacy evaluation thus the trial had a median 1.9 years of followup. one rct the st. francis heart study n 1 005 evaluated the benefit of atorvastatin 20 mg daily in individuals with elevated cac tables 32 and 33 .121 this trial was conducted in the united states. the mean age was 59 years old and approximately 26 percent of participants were women. participants had to have an ldl 175 mg dl. approximately 9 percent of participants had diabetes and 13 percent were current smokers. all participants were given low dose aspirin as part of the trial. the mean hscrp in participants was lower in this trial about 2 mg l as compared to the jupiter trial about 4 mg l . an abnormal cac was defined as above the 80th percentile for age and sex. this trial also evaluated vitamin c and e data not discussed . the primary endpoint was a composite cvd outcome that included mi cva and revascularization. this study did not report on adverse effects of atorvastatin. this was a fair quality trial in that it was not powered for composite cvd outcomes due to a lower than expected event rate. trial investigators terminated the study early with mean 4.3 years of followup. cardiovascular outcomes aaa and popadad found no difference between low dose aspirin and placebo in composite cvd outcomes tables 34 and 35 . the aaa trial reported 10.8 percent cvd events in the aspirin and 10.5 percent events in the placebo group with an adjusted hr of 1.0 95 ci 0.81 to 1.23 at 8.2 years of followup. the popadad trial reported 18.2 percent cvd events in the aspirin and 18.3 percent events in the placebo group hr 0.98 95 ci 0.76 to 1.26 at 6.7 nontraditional risk factors for cvd 42 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc years of followup. both trials reported age and sex stratified analyses again with no differences between randomized groups tables 36 and 37 . both trials also found no difference in all cause mortality. jupiter found a benefit for hscrp guided high intensity statin therapy tables 34 and 35 . this trial reported 1.6 percent cvd events in the rosuvastatin group compared to 2.8 percent events in the placebo group hr 0.56 95 ci 0.46 to 0.69 at 1.9 years of followup. benefits were statistically significant for both mi and cva outcomes individually. benefits were statistically significant for both men and women as well as for people with a baseline frs of 10 percent and 10 percent 10 year risk in a priori specified analyses i.e. there was no suggestion of effect modification based on interaction testing table 37 . this trial also found a statistically significant difference in all cause mortality with 2.2 percent deaths in the rosuvastatin group versus 2.8 percent deaths in the placebo group hr 0.80 95 ci 0.67 to 0.97 . the st. francis heart study found no statistically significant benefit for cac guided moderate intensity statin therapy but was not adequately powered tables 34 and 35 .121 this trial reported 6.9 percent cvd events in the atorvastatin group compared to 9.9 percent events in the placebo group rr 0.70 95 ci 0.44 to 1.10 at 4.3 years of followup. among participants with baseline cac greater than 400 there was a statistically significant reduction in cvd events in the atorvastatin group compared to the placebo group 8.7 with events versus 15.0 p 0.046 it is not clear whether this was a prespecified subgroup analysis and interaction testing is not reported. kq5. what are the harms of treatment guided by nontraditional risk factors summary three of the four included rcts for kq4 reported harms of treatment i.e. aspirin or statin guided by nontraditional risk factor assessment.120 122 123 we found no other studies evaluating harms meeting our inclusion criteria. neither aspirin trial aaa and popadad found evidence of increased major bleeding including hemorrhagic cva for low dose aspirin compared to placebo after approximately 7 to 8 years of followup. the jupiter trial did find evidence of an increased incidence of diabetes in the high intensity statin therapy group 3.0 percent compared to placebo 2.4 percent p 0.01 after approximately 2 years however it did not find evidence of increases in other serious adverse effects including hemorrhagic cva or myopathic events for high intensity statin therapy compared to placebo. detailed results description of studies please refer to the kq4 section tables 32 and 33 . nontraditional risk factors for cvd 43 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc harms aaa and popadad found no statistically significant difference between low dose aspirin and placebo group in major bleeding events table 38 . overall the number of adverse events was low. the aaa trial reported 2.0 percent major bleeding events e.g. major gi bleeding hemorrhagic cva and intracranial bleeding in the aspirin and 1.2 percent events in the placebo group hr 1.71 95 ci 0.99 to 2.97 at 8.2 years of followup. the popadad trial reported only on fatal hemorrhagic cva. event rates were low with no statistically significant difference between the aspirin and placebo groups. jupiter found a statistically significant increase in physician diagnosed diabetes but not in other serious adverse events in the rosuvastatin group compared to the placebo group table 38 . this trial reported 3.0 percent incident diabetes in the rosuvastatin group compared to 2.4 percent in the placebo group rr 1.25 95 ci 1.04 to 1.50 at 1.9 years of followup. however there was no difference in a composite outcome of serious adverse events between the rosuvastatin group 15.2 percent versus the placebo group 15.5 percent rr 0.98 95 ci 0.91 to 1.06 and no difference in hemorrhagic cva between the two groups but this outcome was rare 0.1 . chapter 4. discussion summary of evidence a large body of evidence has accrued since the previous uspstf insufficient evidence statements for nontraditional risk factors in chd risk assessment in 2009 and for abi in cvd risk assessment in 2013 tables 39 and 40 . however we still lack direct evidence from adequately powered trials evaluating the impact of cvd risk assessment with or without the addition of nontraditional risk factors on patient health outcomes. while comparative trials evaluating the incremental value of nontraditional risk factor assessment to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment on patient health outcomes may never be conducted there are two trials currently in progress that will help us understand the role of abi and cac screening in people without known cvd the danish cardiovascular screening trial dancavas and the risk or benefit in screening for cardiovascular disease robinsca trial appendix f . dancavas is a large screening rct n 40 000 in older adults evaluating abi and cac to screen for vascular disease.131 dancavas began in 2014 and has primary outcomes including cvd morbidity and mortality at 10 years however interim analyses are planned for 2018. robinsca is a similarly large rct n 40 000 in asymptomatic adults ages 45 to 74 years old in the netherlands evaluating cvd risk assessment using score versus cac screening versus a control group.132 the primary outcome of this trial is fatal or nonfatal chd at 5 years with results expected in 2019. the recently published viborg vascular viva population based screening trial for aaa pad and hypertension does not address the additive value of abi to traditional cvd risk assessment and does not allow for the assessment of benefit of abi separate from the other two screening interventions.133 short of having trial data on health outcomes we should consider the incremental improvement of nontraditional risk factor assessment with the abi hscrp and cac on the calibration discrimination and risk reclassification of traditional cardiovascular risk assessment. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 44 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc predictive performance of abi hscrp and cac unfortunately risk prediction studies to date offer limited information about how abi hscrp or cac can improve the calibration agreement between predicted and observed events of pce or frs risk assessment due to sparse and inconsistent reporting of various measures table 39 . the sparse reporting of calibration measures is not surprising and is consistent with the findings of other systematic reviews 13 as historically the performance of risk prediction models has focused on discrimination.134 while limited reporting of measures of calibration suggests that all three nontraditional risk factors can improve model fit the lack of reporting on calibration plots and o e ratios as well as the overall inconsistent reporting of calibration measures severely limits our ability to understand the clinical meaning of these improvements in calibration. given that current risk assessment tools can both under and overestimate cvd risk it is crucial to understand the impact of these risk factors on calibration as much as their impact on discrimination and risk reclassification. in addition because the c statistic or auc is a rank order statistic a model can discriminate well but still systematically under or overestimate risk.57 overall performance measures such as likelihood statistics aic bic and r2 were reported more commonly than measures directly assessing calibration however since these measures capture both discrimination and calibration improvements in these measures could indicate improvements to one or both aspects of model performance. because we found that nontraditional risk factors can improve discrimination the interpretation of improvements in overall performance measures on calibration is unclear. fortunately we have more complete data to inform the impact of nontraditional risk factors on discrimination and risk reclassification when added to traditional risk factor assessment. very few risk prediction studies in this review evaluated base models using published coefficients of existing models therefore do not answer the pragmatic question for clinicians on whether to add abi hscrp or cac to their existing cardiovascular risk assessment using publicly available tools like the pce or atp iii s risk calculator. overall we found only four studies that evaluated the pce as a base model therefore we cannot make any definitive conclusions about the value of abi hscrp or cac to the pce and in particular about the ability of these nontraditional risk factors to improve the performance of the pce. almost the entirety of the evidence is focused on an frs base model. the ipd meta analysis by the abi collaboration demonstrated the improvement in both discrimination and risk reclassification after adding abi to the frs using published coefficients. this improvement was most promising for women and women at intermediate risk however this is likely due to the poor base model performance. when investigators developed new models for women which corrected the poor calibration and discrimination of the base model improvements in discrimination and reclassification for abi were no longer statistically significant. findings from other studies were generally concordant with findings from the ipd meta analysis. findings for hscrp were less consistent compared to abi or cac. limited studies with methodological limitations suggest that at best the addition of hscrp to the frs results in small improvements in discrimination and reclassification. the ipd meta analysis by the emerging risk factors collaboration demonstrated statistically significant improvements in the c statistic of only 0.0039 and nri of only 0.0152 when hscrp was added to the frs but this was a model development study. these improvements appear to accrue more for men than women. sex differences observed in the abi evidence base can be explained by nontraditional risk factors for cvd 45 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc performance of base models rather than biologic plausibility that the abi performs differently in men and women this is likely the case for sex differences in hscrp as well although more limited reporting about sex specific base model performance prevents definitive conclusions. cac appears to be the most promising nontraditional risk factor however this interpretation is based on a much smaller body of evidence compared to abi or hscrp. cac when added to the frs consistently resulted in improvements in discrimination and reclassification in studies using published coefficients and model development studies. when we could evaluate event and nonevent nri separately the improvement in nri for abi and cac appeared to be driven by the event as opposed to nonevent nri meaning the upward classification of individuals who had a cardiovascular event. because the prevalence of nonevents is substantially greater than that of events the total nri may overstate the magnitude of improvement as the event and nonevent nri are weighted equally. in addition a negative nonevent nri i.e. erroneous classification of individuals without events into a higher risk category may lead to harms due to overtreatment or overutilization.67 for both abi and cac there was evidence of negative nonevent nris. in the abi collaboration ipd meta analysis the nonevent nri was negative and statistically significant for women for whom benefits were most promising and similarly across the cac evidence base the nonevent nri was negative and sometimes statistically significant . experts have advocated for the separate consideration of nri in the intermediate risk group as these are the individuals for whom the initiation of preventive therapies may be less certain. in instances where the bias corrected nriint was reported or could be calculated it was not consistently greater than the nri observed for all individuals all risk strata . the most commonly used risk strata for the frs base model was low 10 intermediate 10 19 or 20 and high 20 . these risk strata may no longer be as relevant for clinical decisionmaking because current practice has lowered the threshold to initiate preventive therapies for example with statins uspstf at 10 or greater acc aha at 7.5 or greater . clinical importance of improvements in discrimination and risk reclassification measures of discrimination auc c statistic and reclassification nri are important to evaluate in the context of one another in addition to measures of calibration. for cardiovascular risk prediction small changes in risk that do not change clinical decisionmaking can result in changes in discrimination. conversely the c statistic or auc can be insensitive and new markers can improve reclassification with little change in discrimination.134 reclassification captures changes in risk categories or decision thresholds however the nri only measures the difference between the base and extended models without providing actual information about the performance of the models. both the c statistic auc and nri lack consensus on how to interpret clinical meaningfulness. while the nri may be more clinically helpful because it captures changes in risk categories it is a combination of four proportions. event nri and nonevent nri may be easier to interpret as they are each a difference in proportion. for example the event nri is the net proportion of events assigned to a higher risk that is those with an event correctly reclassified into a higher risk category minus those with an event who were incorrectly reclassified into a lower group. for cardiovascular risk assessment using three nontraditional risk factors for cvd 46 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc categories low intermediate and high risk the nri equally weights reclassification for example all upward movement in the low to intermediate risk is valued the same as low to high risk and likewise intermediate to high risk.67 this is further complicated by the point made earlier that the risk strata used to calculate the categorical nri may no longer be relevant to clinical practice. for example much of the reclassification evidence base uses three categories whereas clinical decisions are based on a single threshold of 7.5 or 10 10 year risk so the overall nri will take into account movement between groups that is irrelevant for clinical decisionmaking e.g. movement between 10 20 and 20 10 year risk . the bottom line is there is no consensus on a threshold for clinically meaningful changes in the c statistic auc or nri. however we can state that there is moderate strength of evidence that the magnitude of improvement in discrimination and reclassification can be clinically important for abi for populations in whom the frs has poor discrimination and for cac but not for hscrp. these findings of potential benefit should be tempered by the observed misclassification of individuals negative nonevent nri observed in both these instances and other potential harms specifically for cac discussed below . experts in cac have argued that a cac score of 0 may be helpful in reducing unnecessary care subtractive medicine as a cac score of 0 portends a good prognosis in asymptomatic persons and many asymptomatic persons have a cac score of 0 e.g. in the eisner rct 48 had a cac score of 0 .135 an analysis of the mesa cohort by nasir and colleagues showed that the distribution of cac is heterogeneous across groups recommended not recommended or considered for statins as defined by the 2013 acc aha cholesterol guidelines.136 these recommendation groups are defined by a combination of risk equivalents ldl of 190 mg dl or greater or diabetes or calculated 10 year pce risk. in this analysis 41 percent of those who would be recommended a statin based on ldl of 190 mg dl or greater diabetes or 7.5 percent or greater 10 year risk have a cac score of 0 and a 10 year risk of approximately 5 . while this analysis shows that a cac score of 0 can appropriately downward reclassify a large proportion of individuals previously recommended a statin the downward classification may be of nominal clinical importance because observed risk of 5 is still in the statin considered range. these results are not comparable to the analysis by yeboah and colleagues90 used in our evidence review because of the different definition of risk categories i.e. the use of risk equivalents in one but not both analyses and the use of a different reclassification strategy pce in addition to cac versus a cac score of 0 . the mesa analysis by yeboah and colleagues90 shows that almost half of individuals with diabetes have calculated 10 year risk of less than 7.5 percent whereas these individuals are automatically placed in the statin recommended group by acc aha guidelines33 and in the analysis by nasir and colleagues.136 although this analysis underscores the potential of cac to reclassify individuals across the risk spectrum the body of evidence reviewed for this report suggests that on a population level the majority of reclassification is for individuals moved to a higher category of risk i.e. more persons are inappropriately being reclassified to a higher risk than appropriately being reclassified to a lower risk category . the use of nontraditional risk factor measurement is primarily important for aiding in the decisions to initiate preventive cardiovascular therapies i.e. aspirin and statin by improving on existing cardiovascular risk assessment for example in persons for whom traditional risk prediction does not perform adequately. currently the uspstf has recommendations to initiate preventive low dose aspirin and statins based on a 10 year cvd risk of 10 percent or greater nontraditional risk factors for cvd 47 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc while the acc aha advocates for initiating a discussion for statin initiation at a threshold of 7.5 percent using their pce. we illustrate the impact of reclassification using current day thresholds based on reclassification tables from three selected included studies table 41 . in this example we show the absolute number of people and people per 100 who are appropriately and inappropriately reclassified with abi hscrp or cac using data from the mesa cohort90 and the two ipd meta analyses included in our review.65 66 these examples were selected because the studies reported reclassification tables and they represented the most applicable studies to current day practice in the united states. the mesa analysis used a published coefficient model and evaluated both the frs and pce and the ipd meta analyses represent the largest assembled populations for their respective analyses. for the frs based analyses which used 3 risk strata the top 2 risk strata 10 20 and 20 were combined to conform to the current uspstf recommendation to initiate preventive low dose aspirin and statins based on a 10 year cvd risk of 10 percent. among individuals having an event appropriate reclassification is defined as reclassification above a treatment threshold 7.5 or 10 and inappropriate reclassification is defined as reclassification below a treatment threshold. the converse definitions are used for individuals not having an event. in our example for the pce cac has the greatest reclassification but does inappropriately reclassify individuals who did not have an event to above the 7.5 percent treatment threshold. in the example for the pce 76 people having cvd events were appropriately reclassified upward when cac was added to risk assessment and 19 people who had events were inappropriately reclassified downward who had a cvd event a net improvement of 57 individuals among the 320 having events about 18 per 100 people reported event nri of 0.178 95 ci 0.080 0.256 . however in the primary prevention populations to which cvd risk assessment with the pce or frs applies the majority of people will not experience a cvd event. with the addition of cac to risk assessment 202 people not having events are appropriately reclassified downward but 496 people are inappropriately reclassified upward on net a worsening of reclassification of 294 individuals out of 4865 not having events or about 6 per 100 people reported nonevent nri of 0.059 95 ci 0.075 0.030 . therefore the nri of 0.119 95 ci 0.080 0.256 does not convey that for cac a sizeable proportion of individuals who are not having events will now be considered for treatment. the addition of the abi to the frs in women showed a similar pattern. some experts and advocates have argued that nontraditional risk factor assessment may also be helpful for individuals who choose not to initiate preventive therapy e.g. aspirin or statin although this has not been proven. one comprehensive systematic review addressed the effect of cac screening on risk perception adherence to medication and behavioral therapies.10 this review included 15 studies of varying study designs. while the findings were somewhat mixed across different studies and outcomes in general this review found that cac screening can increase adherence to lifestyle changes increase use of preventive medications influence physician prescribing practices and improve risk factor control from 6 months up to 6 years compared to no cac screening. only two of these studies evaluated traditional cardiovascular risk assessment versus cac.137 138 neither of these studies found that screening cac was superior to traditional cardiovascular risk assessment on use of preventive medications or risk factor control cholesterol . nontraditional risk factors for cvd 48 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc reynolds risk score the reynolds risk score rrs which includes hscrp family history and hba1c for individuals with diabetes in the model for women but not men 15 50 was not evaluated in this review because the addition of multiple nontraditional risk factors precludes examination of the additional value of hscrp alone. external validation studies of the rrs have shown moderate discrimination in the range of 0.72 to 0.756 these values are similar to those of hscrp extended models in our review such as the ipd ma which reports an extended model discrimination of 0.7179.65 139 140 these external validation studies are mixed with respect to findings for calibration. the external validation study in the mesa cohort showed an overprediction of 9 percent in men and an underprediction of 21 percent in women 139 calibration plots from an external validation study in the women s health initiative however showed o e ratios very close to 1 for most of the spectrum of risk and overprediction of only about 4 percent in persons with 15 percent 10 year risk which is not clinically important as these persons are already above treatment thresholds of 7.5 or 10 .140 differences in findings for calibration could be due to differences in risk and case mix between validation and development cohorts and or differences in ascertainment of cvd events across the different cohorts.141 in our analyses evaluating the incremental value of hscrp to improve risk prediction calibration outcomes were reported in only about one third of included studies 9 of 25 articles and preferred measures of calibration such as graphical measures and o e were rarely reported. from these limited data we conclude that hscrp could improve the calibration of risk prediction models at least for individuals in some risk groups. therefore the evidence for calibration of the rrs shown in these external validation studies is consistent with our review s finding. harms of nontraditional risk factors while cac is the most promising nontraditional risk factor to improve discrimination and reclassification it does have potential harms. we have previously discussed the issue with erroneous upward reclassification for individuals without a cardiovascular event which is not specific to cac. in addition ct imaging for cac is associated with exposure to low dose radiation and a potential for increased burden of testing procedures. our review found that the estimate of radiation exposure or effective radiation dose is low 0.4 to 2.1 msv per exam. given that the average amount of radiation exposure from background sources in the united states is about 3.0 msv per year 142 ionizing radiation from a single examination for cac is low. even low doses of ionizing radiation however may convey a small excess risk of cancer.143 144 literature reviews of radiation exposure or effective radiation dose from ct imaging for cac confirm that the exposure to radiation is low but observe a wider range of doses. one review found the effective dose in 20 studies ranged from 0.5 to 7.7 msv excluding cac from ct angiography .129 this review found that prospective ecg triggering had lower radiation exposure than retrospective ecg gating. another recent review of 20 mdct imaging protocols for cac found a median exposure of 2.3 msv per exam and a range of 0.8 to 10.5 msv per exam.130 this review also modeled cancer risk using the risk models from the national research council s biological effects of ionizing radiation bier vii committee. based on a one time nontraditional risk factors for cvd 49 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc screen at age 40 years using a median dose of 2.3 msv the estimated lifetime excess cancer risk of 9 range 3 to 42 cancers per 100 000 men and 28 range 9 to 130 cancers per 100 000 women. this excess risk decreased as individuals aged. the greater risk in women was attributed to excess breast cancer risk and a 2 fold higher lung cancer risk. cac may also increase downstream health care utilization. we found mixed findings on whether cac increased subsequent cardiac imaging or procedures including revascularization . in the eisner rct cac did not increase subsequent imaging or procedures however a large retrospective analysis of medicare claims data found an association of greater cardiac imaging and revascularization compared to an hscrp or lipid screening group. even if cac does increase downstream testing in certain practice settings it is unclear if this is a net benefit or harm as the analysis from the medicare claims data also found a nonstatistically significant association of fewer cvd events in the cac versus hscrp screening groups. a very small body of evidence clinical heterogeneity and methodological limitations of retrospective analyses of claims data prevent any definitive conclusions. none of our included studies examined the prevalence of incidental findings on ct imaging for cac. one systematic review included seven studies of screening cac that reported the prevalence of any incidental findings majority pulmonary nodules which ranged from 8 to 58.1 percent of scans 2.8 to 41.5 percent for significant findings defined as cases requiring followup and 0.07 to 1.2 percent for newly diagnosed cancer.145 again it is unclear whether identification of incidental findings represents a net benefit or harm. we found no studies that addressed downstream utilization of medical testing or procedures secondary to incidental findings and or benefits harms from detection of incidental findings. benefits and harms of nontraditional risk factor guided therapy we found no studies that evaluated the benefit of nontraditional risk factor assessment when added to traditional multivariate risk factor assessment. nonetheless we included four trials that evaluated abi hscrp and cac guided therapy in asymptomatic individuals without known cvd. jupiter found a benefit in cvd morbidity and all cause mortality for high intensity statin therapy consisting of rosuvastatin 20 mg in people with an elevated hscrp but normal ldl less than 130 mg dl compared to a placebo group. at baseline approximately half of the participants had a 10 year risk of 10 percent or less as calculated by the frs and therefore would likely not have been treated with a statin. all trial participants had an hscrp of 2.0 mg l or greater and thus this trial provides no direct evidence comparing treatment in those with an elevated compared to a normal hscrp. exploratory subgroup analyses by baseline hscrp showed an increased absolute risk of a cardiovascular event with higher hscrp levels but similar relative risk reductions with rosuvastatin across the range of hscrp levels included in the study.146 it is unclear whether the benefit seen in jupiter is applicable to just those with an elevated hscrp or if this benefit would be applicable to a broader unselected population as studies have shown mixed results about whether the benefit of statins extends to both those with normal and elevated hscrp. a post hoc analysis of the afcaps texcaps trial showed the strongest support for effect modification among participants with ldl less than 149 mg dl low or moderate intensity statin lovastatin 20 or 40 mg was associated with a reduction in chd events in those with baseline hscrp of 1.6 mg l or greater rr 0.58 95 ci 0.34 to nontraditional risk factors for cvd 50 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc 0.98 but not in those with hscrp below this level rr 1.08 95 ci 0.56 to 2.08 the p value in a test for interaction among statin treatment crp and lipid level was 0.06.147 this was the hypothesis generating analysis for jupiter which restricted its inclusion to individuals with normal ldl and elevated hscrp 2.0 mg l . hope 3 which evaluated moderate intensity statin therapy consisting of rosuvastatin 10 mg compared to placebo showed largely overlapping confidence intervals for cvd outcomes in analyses stratified by a hscrp threshold of 2.0 mg l hr 0.82 95 ci 0.64 to 1.06 for hscrp 2.0 versus 0.77 95 ci 0.60 to 0.98 for hscrp 2.0 p for interaction 0.694 .148 the heart protection study which included a higher risk population existing chd occlusive disease diabetes or receiving antihypertensive therapy similarly showed no evidence of effect modification for cvd events by crp level with an overall event rate ratio of 0.76 95 ci 0.72 to 0.81 for moderate intensity statin therapy consisting of simvastatin 40 mg versus placebo.149 the benefit observed in jupiter may represent an upper bound as the trial was stopped early at 1.9 years of followup. this trial found an increase in diabetes incidence in the statin group compared to the placebo group but no other serious adverse events. the nonstatistically significant results of the st. francis trial which evaluate cac guided statin therapy should not be directly compared to jupiter i.e. lack of benefit for cac guided statin therapy and benefit for hscrp guided statin therapy as the st. francis trial evaluated moderate intensity statin therapy as opposed to high intensity and was not adequately powered to detect differences in cvd events. limitations of the review our review has numerous limitations. first we focused this review on the three most promising nontraditional risk factors abi hscrp and cac. we also restricted our inclusion to english language studies and studies in developed countries although we do not believe this restriction biased our review findings. given the large volume of studies included for kq2 we made some explicit exclusions so as to focus on the most clinically relevant analyses such as the exclusion of cva specific outcomes cac derived from lung cancer screening or ct angiography studies in which the comparator was a single nontraditional risk factor alone and analyses that did not allow us to isolate the contribution of individual nontraditional risk factors i.e. studies using base models including other risk factors and studies comparing the frs to the rrs . additionally studies were excluded if it could not be determined whether reclassification was appropriate i.e. reclassification was reported without respect to events . additionally the predictive value of traditional risk factors such as total or hdl cholesterol was taken as given but some literature suggests that these too might be very small to small when assessed in terms of the c statistic.65 we were conservative in our data synthesis across the body of evidence that is we did not quantitatively pool c statistics auc or nri and we did not make direct comparisons of finding across studies. even though we stratified our discussion by base model the frs vs. pce and model type published coefficients vs. model development many of the studies had variations in included populations e.g. inclusion of patients with diabetes distribution of cvd risk differences in analyses e.g. model recalibration time horizon differences in outcomes predicted e.g. hard vs. soft events and definitions of risk strata that prohibited more definitive conclusions. we did however explore differences in nontraditional risk factor performance in those studies which examined more than one nontraditional risk factor. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 51 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc limitations of included studies and future research needs no studies have evaluated the clinical impact of cardiovascular risk assessment with or without nontraditional risk factors on patient health outcomes. clinical impact studies should be a priority if any of these nontraditional risk factors are implemented on a targeted population level. largely speaking the proliferation of cardiovascular risk assessment literature particularly model development studies without external validation will not provide the much needed clinical answers on nontraditional risk factor assessment. however there are some exceptions. given that traditional risk tools can overestimate cvd risk it is crucial to understand the incremental value of promising nontraditional risk factors on calibration as well as discrimination and reclassification. more consistent reporting of calibration plots will allow for better understanding of what individuals will benefit from improved calibration and o e ratios will facilitate comparison of calibration across studies. to understand the true net benefit of reclassification robust reporting of event and nonevent nri and reporting of integrated measures that weight the erroneous misclassification for nonevent proportionally are important. more studies in diverse populations will aid in understanding whether there are population segments for whom traditional risk factor assessment may underperform to a greater degree and thereby achieve greater benefit from nontraditional risk factor assessment. external validation studies of extended models with nontraditional risk factors are needed. apart from the abi collaboration ipd meta analysis none of the extended models has been externally validated. given that cac appears to be the most promising nontraditional risk factor an ipd meta analysis for cac including longer followup of included cohorts would be informative in furthering understanding of reclassification in subpopulations e.g. intermediate risk groups those for whom traditional risk factor assessment typically underperforms and vet what impact a cac score of 0 has on appropriate downward classification of people at intermediate or high risk by traditional risk assessment. well designed prospective studies that are reflective of real world practice are needed to evaluate the downstream effects of cac on cardiac imaging and revascularization as well as incidental findings since these are common. these include studies that aid in determining whether the identification of incidental findings and or increased health care utilization is a net benefit or net harm. conclusion in the absence of true clinical impact studies reporting cardiovascular morbidity and or mortality we need to understand the incremental value of risk prediction with nontraditional risk factors using calibration discrimination and reclassification. despite limitations in the reporting of these performance measures as well as limitations in the measures themselves we can draw some conclusions. there remains scant information on the incremental value of nontraditional risk factors to help with the problem of miscalibration of traditional cardiovascular risk assessment. evidence from one large ipd meta analysis suggests that clinicians could use abi in addition to the frs to improve upon discrimination and reclassification in populations for whom the frs model has poor discrimination. while cac appears to be the most promising nontraditional risk nontraditional risk factors for cvd 52 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc factor to improve discrimination and reclassification it is based on a smaller body of evidence which lacks ipd meta analyses. cac may also result in additional downstream testing procedures and it is unclear whether these sequelae represent a net benefit or harm to individuals. one large rct shows that high intensity statin therapy in individuals with elevated hscrp and normal lipid levels can reduce cvd morbidity and mortality but it is unclear whether these benefits would not also be applicable to individuals with normal hscrp. the use of hscrp guided therapy has not been evaluated against therapy guided by multivariate cardiovascular risk assessment. nontraditional risk factors for cvd 53 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc references 1. world

group being some parsing of the population e.g. by decile risk strata a signif icant p value signals poor f it. the test is sensitive to how groups are constructed and is sensitive to sample size often being nonsignif icant for small n and signif icant for large n.59 the hosmer lemeshow 2 does not adjust for time to event and several approaches have been developed to extend the test for survival data but w ere not reported in included studies .60 overall performance captures both calibration and discrimination aspects 57 akaike information criterion aic and bayes information criterion bic the aic and bic are measures used during model development to aid in inclusion or exclusion of predictors in a model. the aic is a function of log likelihood that adds a penalty for each added predictor. the bic is similar although it imposes a greater penalty than the aic for added variables. low er values of both measures indicate better model f it. a change of 10 in the aic has been proposed to indicate strong evidence for a difference in models.84 likelihood ratio 2 likelihood ratio 2 is a global test of model f it and a function of the number of terms in the model. higher values for the ratio or difference betw een models indicate better f it as do low er absolute log likelihood values .83 a global 2 is generally the same as a likelihood 2 tw ice the log likelihood ratio . brier score the brier score computes the sum of squared differences betw een observed outcomes and f itted probability w here low er values indicate that predicted probabilities are closer to observed outcomes.83 r2 there are a number of w ays to calculate an r2 for a logistic regression.59 nagelkerke s generalized r2 w hich is reported in included studies in this body of literature is generally analogous to the percentage of variance explained in a linear model and is adjusted to a range of 0 to 1. higher values indicate better f it.83 the r2 is more helpful than the brier score because it can be compared across models studies. discrimination c statistic or area under the curve auc change in c statistic or auc the probability that for a randomly selected pair of individuals one w ith disease and the other w ithout the person w ith disease w ill have the higher estimated disease probability according to the model.83 the c statistic can be conceptualized as the area under the roc curve plots sensitivity against 1 specif icity as a rank order statistic it is insensitive to systematic errors in calibration.57 the harrell s c statistic is an extension of the auc for survival analysis allow ing for right censored data and variable time to follow up.158 the change in c statistic or auc can be insensitive in assessing the impact of adding new predictors to a model and the impact of a new predictor on c statistics is low er w hen other strong predictors are in the model.134 risk reclassif ication net reclassif ication index or improvement nri the sum of

adults 2016 b the uspstf recommends that adults w ithout a history of cardiovascular disease cvd i.e. symptomatic coronary artery disease or ischemic stroke use a low to moderate dose statin for the prevention of cvd events and mortality w hen all of the follow ing criteria are met 1 they are aged 40 to 75 years 2 they have 1 or more cvd risk factors i.e. dyslipidemia diabetes hypertension or smoking and 3 they have a calculated 10 year risk of a cardiovascular event of 10 or greater. identif ication of dyslipidemia and calculation of 10 year cvd event risk requires universal lipids screening in adults aged 40 to 75 years. c although statin use may be beneficial for the primary prevention of cvd events in some adults w ith a 10 year cvd event risk of less than 10 the likelihood of benefit is smaller because of a low er probability of disease and uncertainty in individual risk prediction. clinicians may choose to offer a low to moderate dose statin to certain adults w ithout a history of cvd w hen all of the follow ing criteria are met 1 they are aged 40 to 75 years 2 they have 1 or more cvd risk factors i.e. dyslipidemia diabetes hypertension or smoking and 3 they have a calculated 10 year risk of a cardiovascular event of 7.5 to 10 . i the uspstf concludes that the current evidence is insuff icient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating statin use for the primary prevention of cvd events and mortality in adults 76 years and older w ithout a history of heart attack or stroke. to determine w hether a patient is a candidate for statin therapy clinicians must f irst determine the patient s risk of having a future cvd event. how ever clinicians ability to accurately identify a patient s true risk is imperfect because the best currently available risk estimation tool w hich uses the pooled cohort equations from the 2013 american college of cardiology american heart association acc aha guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk has been show n to overestimate actual risk in multiple external validation cohorts. the reasons for this possible overestimation are still unclear. the pooled cohort equations w ere derived from prospective cohorts of volunteers from studies conducted in the 1990s and may not be generalizable to a more contemporary and diverse patient population seen in current clinical practice. furthermore no statin clinical trials enrolled patients based on a specif ic risk threshold calculated using a cvd risk prediction tool rather patients had 1 or more cvd risk factors other than age and sex as a requirement for trial enrollment. because the pooled cohort equations lack precision the risk estimation tool should be used as a starting point to discuss w ith patients their desire for lifelong statin therapy. the likelihood that a patient w ill benefit from statin use depends on his or her absolute baseline risk of having a future cvd event a risk estimation that is imprecise based on the currently available risk estimation tool. thus clinicians should discuss w ith patients the potential risk of having a cvd event and the expected benefits and harms of statin use. patients w ho place a higher value on the potential benefits than on the potential harms and inconvenience of taking a daily medication may choose to initiate statin use for reduction of cvd risk. the uspstf has made several other recommendations relevant to the prevention of cvd in adults see the other approaches to prevention section . appendix a table 1. uspstf recommendations with reference to cvd risk assessment nontraditional risk factors for cvd 158 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc type topic year grade recommendation clinical considerations around cvd risk assessment aspirin for the prevention of cvd and colorectal cancer 2016 b the uspstf recommends initiating low dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease cvd and colorectal cancer crc in adults aged 50 to 59 years w ho have a 10 or greater 10 year cvd risk are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and are w illing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years. c the decision to initiate low dose aspirin use for the primary prevention of cvd and crc in adults aged 60 to 69 years w ho have a 10 or greater 10 year cvd risk should be an individual one. persons w ho are not at increased risk for bleeding have a life expectancy of at least 10 years and are w illing to take low dose aspirin daily for at least 10 years are more likely to benefit. persons w ho place a higher value on the potential benefits than the potential harms may choose to initiate low dose aspirin. i the current evidence is insuff icient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of cvd and crc in adults younger than 50 years. i the current evidence is insuff icient to assess the balance of benefits and harms of initiating aspirin use for the primary prevention of cvd and crc in adults aged 70 years or older. the primary risk factors for cvd include older age male sex race ethnicity abnormal lipid

nontraditional risk factors for cvd 162 kaiser permanente research affil iates epc nri and confidence interval calculations when a study reported a full reclassification table a cross tabulation of risk categories between a base model in this case a model with traditional risk factors only and an extended model which adds a nontraditional risk factor of interest to the base model we used these data to calculate event and nonevent nri for the overall population when these separate measures were not reported. additionally the full reclassification table was used to calculate a bias corrected nri for the intermediate risk group nriint . not having individual level data we derived confidence intervals using a simple variance formula a conservative estimation when compared to bootstrapping techniques as shown by paytner and cook.70 to calculate the overall event and nonevent nris we first defined the upward movement up as a change into higher category and downward movement down as a change into lower category per pencina and colleagues.69 event nri p up event p down event non event nri p down nonevent p up nonevent overall nri event nri nonevent nri nris can be calculated separately for individual risk strata reported in a study and calculation of the nriint is of the most clinical interest given potential treatment uncertainty in this group. however unlike the overall nri for which the null hypothesis of reclassification table is symmetrical and the expected nri overall is 0 the expected nri for the intermediate risk group is not 0 and nonsymmetrical.70 71 thus the intermediate risk group nri would be biased overestimating the reclassification movements potential increase in type i error if not corrected. a bias corrected nriint was calculated by subtracting the expected nriint from the biased nriint.70 based on symmetry assumption we constructed separate expected reclassification tables using the whole observed table for events and nonevents. the expected number in the diagonal cells equaled numbers in the diagonal cells of the observed table. the expected numbers of the off diagonal cells would be the average of the observed number in row r column c and in row c column r.70 from the expected table we calculated the expected nriint as follows expected nriint p int up int event p int down int event p int down int nonevent p int up int nonevent from the observed table we calculated the biased nriint the same way as for expected nriint. thus bias corrected nriint biased nriint expected nriint confidence intervals for the nris above were constructed using the simple variance estimator based n binary outcome data and derived from z statistics formula 70 appendix b. detailed methods nontraditional risk factors for cvd 163 kaiser

healthcare research and quality 2016. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia iii kaiser permanente research affiliates epc structured abstract background for purposes of this report multifactorial dyslipidemia refers to dyslipidemias involving elevated total cholesterol tc or low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c that are not familial hypercholesterolemia fh . there is evidence that elevated tc and ldl c concentrations in childhood and especially adolescence are associated with markers of atherosclerosis in young adults. purpose we conducted this systematic evidence review on the benefits and harms of screening adolescents and children for multifactorial dyslipidemia to support the u.s. preventive services task force uspstf in updating its previous recommendation. data sources we searched medline the cochrane central register of controlled trials and pubmed for trials published between january 1 2006 and december 31 2014 relevant to all key questions kqs posed by the uspstf. we supplemented our searches with reference lists from existing systematic reviews cohort studies suggestions from experts and ongoing trials registered in clinicaltrials.gov. study selection investigators independently evaluated 7 137 abstracts and 537 articles against a priori inclusion criteria. investigators also independently critically appraised each study using design specific quality criteria based on uspstf methods. only fair or good quality studies that met the a priori criteria were chosen for each kq. differences between investigators were resolved by consensus. data extraction and analysis one investigator abstracted data from 16 included studies into evidence tables and a second reviewer verified the accuracy of these data. we qualitatively summarized the evidence regarding screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia and its treatment. results we found no direct evidence for an effect of screening children on adult health outcomes kq1 intermediate health outcomes kq2 harms of screening kq4 or effect of treatment on adult health outcomes kq5 . studies met the inclusion criteria for four kqs. kq3. what is the diagnostic yield of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents neither selective nor universal screening of children for multifactorial dyslipidemia has been evaluated in randomized controlled trials rcts . fair evidence indicates that a screening tc concentration of 200 mg dl the national cholesterol education program s ncep s recommended cut point for high tc has a positive predictive value of 77 percent for a diagnosis of multifactorial dyslipidemia. recent nationally representative prevalence estimates suggest a simulated diagnostic yield of 5.4 percent for 8 to 12 year olds and 6.5 percent for 13 to 17 year olds. simulated diagnostic yields ranged between 4 and 12 percent for different age and body mass index subgroups. based on large recent u.s. studies the highest diagnostic yield appears to be in obese children 12.3 children ages 9 to 11 years 7.2 and adolescents ages 16 to 19 years 7.2 . the coronary artery risk detection in appalachian communities study was conducted in the same age group recommended by the national heart lung and blood screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia iv kaiser permanente research affiliates epc institute expert panel for universal testing so the diagnostic yields of 5.8 percent 8.9 percent and 12.3 percent for healthy weight overweight and obese 10 and 11 year olds are reasonable estimates of what might be seen for those subgroups if screening among 9 to 11 year olds was more widely adopted. kq6. does treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia with lifestyle modifications and or lipid lowering medications in children and adolescents improve intermediate outcomes i.e. reduce lipid concentrations or reverse or slow the progression of atherosclerosis in childhood and adolescence we identified only one rct of a dietary intervention so the body of evidence on this question is fair at best. this trial provided good quality evidence of a modest effect of dietary counseling for a low fat low cholesterol diet on lipid levels in children ages 8 to 10 years with mild to moderate dyslipidemia. after 1 year of relatively intensive counseling mean differences between groups compared to baseline were a decrease of 6 mg dl in mean tc and a decrease of 5 mg dl in mean ldl c both differences were statistically significant. both between group differences were reduced to about 3 mg dl at year 3 and by year 5 were no longer statistically significant. adherence to the diet during the intervention was good and some evidence indicated that diet quality improved in children in the intervention group. a small 4 week rct of flaxseed found no cholesterol lowering effect. we found no evidence to support any other type of treatment for multifactorial dyslipidemia including nutritional supplements or medications. kq7. what are the harms of treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia with lifestyle modifications and or lipid lowering medications in children and adolescents dietary changes made by children in the intervention group of the dietary intervention study in children disc did not adversely affect children s nutritional status growth or development. kq8. what is the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and future incidence of myocardial infarction mi and stroke events in adults in a single high quality longitudinal study that included data on adolescents and young adults from the national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes tc concentration at ages 12 to 39 years was not associated with death before age 55 years. the study did find that very high tc concentrations 240 mg dl were significantly associated with premature death in women only although this estimate was based on a small number of deaths. the subgroup of females with concentrations this high is likely dominated by individuals who have fh for whom premature coronary heart disease deaths are expected. the meaning of this finding is unclear because of the small number of deaths in this subgroup. limitations screening kq3 the availability of confirmatory testing for only one of the included studies required that the diagnostic yield be estimated from simulations. the screening evidence draws heavily from screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia v kaiser permanente research affiliates epc epidemiologic studies rather than screening trials. the prevalence of elevated cholesterol concentrations across broad age ranges as is often reported is less meaningful than age group specific rates given the known variation by age. only one school based study was relevant to the primary care setting. the use of the fixed ncep thresholds for defining elevated tc and ldl c concentrations makes the prevalence of dyslipidemia and diagnostic yield difficult to interpret because they do not account for variability by age and sex. finally incomplete tracking of lipid concentrations between childhood adolescence and adulthood is another limitation of this body of evidence. multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents younger than age 20 years is likely to resolve in the young adult years thus the importance of dyslipidemia identified in childhood or adolescence for health in adulthood is unclear. screening trials for detecting multifactorial dyslipidemia that include confirmatory testing are needed. many studies were excluded because they used cut points for cholesterol concentrations that were lower than accepted cut points. even the accepted fixed ncep 1992 cut points for ldl c and tc concentrations may be inadequate because they may over or underidentify children and adolescents depending on age and sex. we found no trials that compared either universal or selective screening to no screening. data on prevalence and diagnostic yield in racially ethnically diverse populations of children are lacking. no studies addressed harms of screening. treatment kq6 and kq7 the disc trial selected children with lower levels of hyperlipidemia making it difficult to generalize results to children with tc concentrations greater than 200 mg dl or ldl c concentrations greater than 130 mg dl. this trial also targeted 8 to 10 year olds so the impact of dietary intervention on adolescents is unknown. the intensity of the counseling intervention limits the generalizability of this treatment to primary care settings where trained nutritional counselors may not be part of the health care team. finally the clinical importance of the small impact on cholesterol levels in the 1 to 3 years of the study time frame is unclear. the evidence regarding treatment has several gaps. we found only one high quality rct of dietary intervention for children with multifactorial dyslipidemia. larger rcts with long term followup are needed. rigorous trials of dietary supplements and medications to reduce levels of atherogenic lipids in children and adolescents are also needed. our search revealed no trials of statins in this population. the treatment studies reviewed for inclusion also relied on various tc and ldl c cut points often below the standard ncep thresholds. few studies followed participants for a year or longer. outcomes kq8 outcomes for adolescents were not reported separately from those for young adults. the single included study for kq8 reported all cause and endogenous cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality an outcome which would be more closely linked to the causal pathway. long term followup cohort studies of children are needed to better understand the association between pediatric dyslipidemia and adult mi and stroke. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia vi kaiser permanente research affiliates epc conclusions we found no direct evidence for an effect of cholesterol screening on intermediate or health outcomes. only one study provided a diagnostic yield for tc screening 5.8 . simulated diagnostic yields in data from large u.s. population based studies show variation in tc concentrations by age and body mass index. there were no studies of diagnostic yield in selective screening and no studies on the harms of screening. no evidence was found for an effect of treatment on health outcomes in adulthood mi and stroke . dietary counseling may lower tc and ldl c concentrations by 5 to 7 mg dl over 3 years but this intervention was relatively intensive and the effect on lipids dissipates by 5 years. no studies of lipid lowering medications met the inclusion criteria. there is fair evidence of the safety of dietary intervention in 8 to 10 year olds. in one longitudinal study using nhanes data combined for both sexes neither very high nor moderately increased tc concentrations in 12 to 39 year olds was independently associated with death before age 55 years. research needs include randomized trials of screening strategies with confirmatory testing and long term followup as well as rigorous rcts of promising medications supplements and dietary interventions with long term followup. long term followup of pediatric cohorts is needed to better establish the long term health risks conferred by elevated concentrations of tc and ldl c. although not the focus of this systematic review our findings support a re examination of the commonly accepted fixed ncep thresholds indicating elevated tc and ldl c concentrations and a reconsideration of age and sex specific thresholds. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia vii kaiser permanente research affiliates epc table of contents chapter 1. introduction

research and quality ahrq commissioned a systematic evidence review to support the u.s. preventive services task force uspstf in updating its 2007 recommendation on screening for lipid disorders in children. pediatric dyslipidemias are a heterogeneous set of conditions that include several monogenic disorders as well as dyslipidemias caused by a variety of factors both genetic and environmental. on the basis of public input on the draft research plan the uspstf decided to conduct two separate systematic reviews one on screening for familial hypercholesterolemia fh and a second on screening for elevated concentrations of atherogenic lipoproteins which we refer to as multifactorial dyslipidemia. the two reviews were conducted by the same evidence based practice center using a search strategy that produced one body of potential evidence encompassing both fh and multifactorial dyslipidemias. the evidence was assessed sequentially for each review s set of key questions kqs . these two concurrent systematic reviews will allow the uspstf to simultaneously consider both bodies of evidence when evaluating the preventive health benefits of screening children and adolescents for dyslipidemias involving elevated concentrations of low density lipoprotein cholesterol ldl c or total cholesterol tc . this review focuses on dyslipidemias involving elevated ldl c or tc that are not fh referred to in this report as multifactorial dyslipidemia. it reviews the evidence for benefits and harms of screening and treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and youth ages 0 to 20 years. cholesterol and dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence cholesterol concentrations in healthy children vary with age. the distribution of tc and ldl c concentrations for example are bimodal in childhood. they start very low at birth increase slowly in the first 2 years of life peak prior to puberty and decrease by 10 to 20 percent or more during adolescence before rising again during late adolescence and young adulthood.1 concentrations of tc and ldl c are generally higher in girls than in boys. the peak in girls precedes that in boys by about 1 year reflecting maturational differences. lipid disorders are defined according to population norms. the lipid research clinics prevalence studies2 used population distributions to determine age and sex specific cut points for tc and ldl c concentrations.3 4 the national heart lung and blood institute nhlbi and american academy of pediatrics have adopted the national cholesterol education program s ncep s recommendation for fixed cutoff values to define dyslipidemia in children tc 200 mg dl and ldl c 130 mg dl .2 these cut points are commonly used in published studies and widely accepted in clinical practice. we will use these in the current review although as noted below fixed thresholds that ignore cholesterol variations by age and sex may screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 1 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc be problematic. condition definition for purposes of this report ldl c concentrations of 130 mg dl or greater or tc concentrations greater than 200 mg dl not due to fh are referred to as multifactorial dyslipidemia and are the focus of the current review. elevations in tc and ldl c concentrations in children and adolescents are of concern because of the role of these lipids in cardiovascular disease in adults and in atherogenesis even at young ages. non high density lipoprotein cholesterol non hdl c which is the difference between tc concentration and the hdl c concentration has emerged as the best marker of atherogenic risk in adults however few screening studies have relied on non hdl c in pediatric populations. extremely high ldl c and tc concentrations are seen in fh which is the subject of the companion systematic evidence review commissioned by the uspstf. in the accompanying systematic review fh is defined using any one of several established diagnostic criteria all of which include a combination of elevated lipid concentrations physical findings family history or genetic tests. children and adolescents with a variety of renal infectious hepatic inflammatory and storage disorders type 1 and 2 diabetes and several other syndromes are also at risk for experiencing elevated ldl c or tc concentrations. these secondary dyslipidemias are beyond the scope of this review. multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents may be associated with environmental factors such as a high fat diet with or without inherited susceptibility. elevated ldl c and tc concentrations appear to be associated with measures of adiposity such as body mass index bmi 5 7 8 and waist circumference.5 6 overweight and obesity now present in nearly a third of u.s. children ages 2 to 19 years 9 are associated with poor nutrition and physical inactivity each of which may be independently associated with childhood dyslipidemia. however the strongest association of bmi is with triglyceride concentrations which are not part of the definition of multifactorial dyslipidemia. some evidence indicates that higher rates of physical activity are associated with lower ldl c concentrations 10 and sedentary activity may be correlated with tc concentrations.11 a family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease is a risk factor for childhood dyslipidemia. even apart from a monogenic condition with high penetrance such as fh there are a number of genetic variations with incomplete penetrance that contribute to multifactorial dyslipidemia.12 in the united states dyslipidemia is experienced disproportionately by adults with hispanic ethnicity13 and those of asian ancestry.14 the prevalence of elevated tc in children ages 8 to 17 years is 7.8 percent according to national health and nutrition examination survey nhanes data from 2011 to 2012.8 the most recent national prevalence estimate nhanes 2007 to 2010 of elevated ldl c concentrations in adolescents is 7.4 percent.15 however these nhanes data rely on a single screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 2 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc lipid test. within person variability of lipid concentrations is considerable such that repeat testing is required to reliably categorize children according to the ncep ranges of acceptable borderline or high.16 therefore these figures overestimate the true prevalence of these dyslipidemias in the population. multifactorial dyslipidemia is a risk factor not a disease. the definition of multifactorial dyslipidemia is based on pediatric norms not on actual risks associated with specific tc or ldl c concentrations. it is unclear to what extent elevated lipid concentrations at ages younger than 18 to 20 years confer future disease risk. natural history and disease burden dyslipidemia atherosclerosis and adult coronary heart disease cholesterol is a lipid that is a vital component of cell membranes and plays a role in synthesis of steroid hormones vitamin d and bile acids. humans absorb dietary cholesterol and also synthesize it de novo. diet and genetics both affect blood cholesterol concentrations as do other environmental factors. cholesterol synthesis and absorption vary greatly in the general population. plasma cholesterol concentrations are the sum of intestinal absorption and hepatic synthesis minus net biliary excretion and cell use. three classes of lipoproteins transport cholesterol in the serum ldl hdl and very low density lipoprotein vldl . tc is comprised of 60 to 70 percent ldl c 20 to 30 percent hdl c and 10 to 15 percent vldl c. the burden of hypercholesterolemia is related to its link to atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease chd . ldl c is the primary atherogenic lipoprotein and is the primary target of cholesterol lowering therapy in adults. some forms of vldl c are precursors to ldl c and also promote atherosclerosis. hdl c concentrations are inversely related to the risk for chd. when elevated ldl c accumulates in blood vessels contributing to plaque formation which occurs in stages starting with fatty streaks and progressing to fibrous plaques. non hdl c provides an estimate of atherogenic particles including ldl c vldl c lipoprotein a and intermediate density lipoprotein.17 in adults elevations in tc ldl c and non hdl c are risk factors for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease specifically chd 17 which may lead to sudden coronary death and myocardial infarction mi . the association of triglyceride levels with chd is unclear and for this reason our definition of multifactorial dyslipidemia excludes triglycerides. other risk factors for chd in adults are age male sex hypertension smoking diabetes obesity physical inactivity an atherogenic diet and family history of early chd. the prevalence of chd increases with age and is higher in men than in women of the same age.18 in 2010 the overall age adjusted prevalence of chd was 6.0 percent in the united states. age specific prevalence was 1.2 percent in 18 to 44 year olds 7.1 percent in 45 to 64 year olds and 19.8 percent in age 65 years and older.18 chd is the leading cause of death in the united states.19 20 identifying and treating dyslipidemia in adults older than age 40 years is common clinical practice in the united states. the uspstf recommends screening adults for dyslipidemia with screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 3 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc specific recommendations depending on age sex and risk factors.21 this recommendation is currently being updated. association between dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence and atherosclerosis multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence is a risk factor for future atherosclerosis. several longitudinal studies have found associations between childhood lipid concentrations and measures of atherosclerosis. studies of 204 individuals in the bogalusa cohort who died between age 2 and 39 years showed a positive association between antemortem ldl c and tc concentrations and atherosclerosis at autopsy as assessed by the presence of fatty streaks and fibrous plaques in the aorta and coronary arteries.22 23 data from the muscatine study showed that ldl c concentrations at ages 8 to 18 years predicted carotid intima media thickness cimt at ages 33 to 42 years.24 a followup of the bogalusa cohort found that ldl c concentrations at ages 5 to 17 years predicted cimt at ages 16 to 19 years.25 in the young finns study ldl26 27 and apob apoa 128 concentrations in adolescence ages 12 to18 years were associated with cimt in adulthood. the pathobiological determinants of atherosclerosis in youth pday study a large cross sectional autopsy study of 15 to 34 year olds who died of external causes found the extent of fatty streaks to be positively associated with postmortem ldl c plus vldl c concentrations and negatively associated with hdl c concentrations.29 in that same study high non hdl c and low hdl c concentrations were associated with more extensive fatty streaks and raised lesions in the abdominal aorta and right coronary artery.30 in contrast a cross sectional u.s. study of 599 children and adolescents found that cimt was not correlated with ldl c concentrations when controlling for obesity.31 in the coronary artery risk development in young adults study cardia not to be confused with the more recent cardiac coronary artery risk detection in appalachian communities study lipid concentrations at baseline in the mid 1980s and at age 20 years were positively associated with cimt and coronary calcium hounsfield units at age 20 years.32 33 exposure to nonoptimal lipid concentrations in young adulthood is associated with atherosclerotic changes later in life. one prospective cohort study of 2 824 persons age 18 to 30 years with nonoptimal concentrations of ldl c defined as 100 mg dl at baseline found that cumulative exposure to higher ldl c or lower hdl c concentrations was associated with markers of atherosclerosis two decades later.33 tracking of dyslipidemia over childhood and adolescence another important aspect of the natural history of multifactorial dyslipidemia in youth is the incomplete tracking of lipid concentrations between childhood adolescence and adulthood. many studies have documented correlation of lipid measurements across the pediatric and young adult age span.34 tracking to adulthood is highest for 12 to 18 year olds.35 however dyslipidemia identified in childhood or adolescence imperfectly predicts adult lipid concentrations.34 for example the muscatine study measured tc concentrations yearly for 6 screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 4 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc years in a longitudinal cohort of almost 9 000 children and adolescents in iowa. although tc measurements were well correlated across the years children in the highest quintile of the tc distribution had only about a 30 percent probability of being in the highest tc quintile 6 years later.36 magnussen and colleagues studied three large longitudinal study populations using two different sets of cut points the fixed ncep cut point and age and sex specific cut points derived from nhanes data. they estimated a positive predictive value ppv of only 32.9 percent ncep and 37.3 percent nhanes for ldl c elevations in adolescence in predicting elevated ldl c 15 to 20 years later 37 indicating that adolescent measurement inaccurately identifies adults with dyslipidemia. in summary there is evidence that elevated ldl c and tc concentrations in childhood and especially adolescence are associated with markers of atherosclerosis in young adults. however the association between multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and clinical chd is unknown and it is difficult to predict which dyslipidemic youth will continue to have elevated cholesterol concentrations in young adulthood. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia rationale for screening in the absence of routine screening elevated tc and ldl c concentrations are unlikely to be detected in most children and adolescents. the rationale for screening children and adolescents for dyslipidemia is to identify affected children interrupt the atherosclerotic process reduce cholesterol burden over the long term and prevent or delay cardiovascular events in adulthood through dietary modification or lipid lowering therapy. screening strategies proposed for multifactorial dyslipidemia have included both selective and universal screening. selective screening may be based on a family history of dyslipidemia or premature cardiovascular disease or on other risk factors such as overweight or obesity. family history based screening has been recommended by several expert guidelines.3 38 the most recent nhlbi expert recommendations advocate universal screening at ages 9 to 11 years and again at ages 17 to 21 years as well as selective screening at other ages.39 laboratory studies tc may be measured with fasting or nonfasting serum testing. concentrations of ldl c may be calculated with the friedewald formula 40 ldl c tc triglycerides 5 hdl c. because the calculation depends on triglyceride concentration an accurate calculated ldl c concentration requires a fasting blood draw. direct ldl c measurement does not require fasting.34 there is evidence however that fasting and nonfasting ldl c concentrations do not differ substantially.41 recent screening recommendations for childhood dyslipidemia have included guidelines for using either ldl c or non hdl c.39 screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 5 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc evolution of clinical practice guidelines in the united states this evidence review comes after more than two decades of efforts to arrive at an effective approach to screening for and treating dyslipidemia. most of these efforts have targeted both multifactorial dyslipidemia as well as fh. in some cases they have also addressed hypertriglyceridemia. below is a chronological summary of the major u.s. expert opinion guidelines and evidence based recommendations for identifying and treating dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence with a focus on elevated tc and ldl c concentrations. ncep 1992 in 1992 ncep a program of the nhlbi convened an expert panel of representatives from the american academy of pediatrics the american academy of family practice the american college of cardiology the american dietetic association and other professional organizations. the panel recommended against universal screening citing several reasons many children with elevated lipid concentrations in childhood are not dyslipidemic as adults the health benefit and safety of lipid lowering treatments was unknown and universal screening could lead to overuse of these drugs in children.2 the panel recommended selective screening based on a family history of premature chd first with tc concentrations and second if tc concentrations were elevated obtaining a fasting lipid panel repeated if abnormal . ncep used cut points derived from the lipid research clinics data but opted to use a single set of thresholds across the pediatric age range. a fasting lipid panel was recommended for children with a tc concentration greater than 200 mg dl on initial screening or with an average tc concentration greater than 170 mg dl on repeat testing. children and adolescents with ldl c concentrations greater than 130 mg dl were counseled to begin a low fat low cholesterol diet ncep step ii diet table 1 with the goal of reducing ldl c concentrations to below 130 mg dl. for children age 10 years and older who had attempted the step ii diet for 6 to 12 months and who continued to have high ldl c concentrations the panel recommended considering treatment with bile sequestering agents. the ldl c cut points defining dyslipidemia were 190 mg dl or in the presence of risk factors greater than 160 mg dl. ncep cautioned against the use of hmg coa reductase inhibitors statins and other agents that had not been well studied in children at that time. uspstf 2007 in the years following the 1992 ncep recommendation numerous studies documented the low sensitivity of screening based on family history.34 some experts began to advocate for universal screening.42 in 2007 the uspstf found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against either routine selective or universal screening of infants children adolescents or young adults up to age 20 years and cited a lack of evidence on the long term efficacy and harms of treatment for dyslipidemia in this age group.34 43 screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 6 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc american academy of pediatrics 2008 in 2008 the american academy of pediatrics committee on nutrition updated an earlier recommendation and continued to advocate for selective screening of children ages 2 to 10 years who had a family history of dyslipidemia or premature chd or unknown family history with other cardiovascular disease risk factors such as overweight hypertension tobacco use or diabetes .44 this statement proposed age and sex specific cut points to define dyslipidemia that were derived from the lipid research clinics prevalence study.4 nutritional and physical activity counseling were recommended for most children. the committee recommended that treatment with bile sequestering agents statins cholesterol absorption inhibitors or fibrates be considered for those age 8 years and older who had 1 ldl c concentrations greater than 190 mg dl 2 ldl c concentrations greater than160 mg dl with family history of chd and cardiac risk factors or 3 ldl c concentrations greater than 130 mg dl and diabetes. nhlbi 2011 in 2011 the most recent guideline on this topic was issued by the nhlbi expert panel on cardiovascular health and risk reduction in children and adolescents.39 the panel issued recommendations for screening and treating dyslipidemia including elevated ldl c and tc concentrations. the panel s recommendations on hypertriglyceridemia are not discussed here. despite noting the age and sex variations in ldl c and tc concentrations the panel recommended continued use of the 1992 fixed ncep cut points. the panel recommended universal screening with a fasting lipid panel at ages 9 to 11 years coinciding with the prepubertal peak in ldl c and tc concentrations and at ages 17 to 21 years. the recommendations also included selective screening based on family history and risk factors at ages 2 to 8 years and at ages 12 to 16 years table 2 . the recommendations call for a two step screening in which children with an initial fasting ldl c concentration greater than 130 mg dl undergo a second fasting ldl c measurement the two measurements are averaged and children with values greater than 130 mg dl are treated for dyslipidemia. for all children and adolescents in this category the panel recommended the child 2 diet increasing physical activity reducing screen time and consideration of the use of plant stanols and sterols and psyllium. in addition the panel recommended treating different groups of children and adolescents with statins depending on age ldl c concentration family history and other risk factors. for example children age 10 years and older with an ldl c concentration of 190 mg dl or greater regardless of family history or risk factors would be considered for statin treatment. statins were also to be considered in 8 or 9 year olds with ldl c concentrations persistently greater than 190 mg dl who were unresponsive to the child 2 diet in the presence of family history or risk factors. children older than age 10 years with an ldl c concentration greater than 160 mg dl or greater than 130 mg dl with a family history or various combinations of risk factors e.g. hypertension obesity tobacco use and low hdl c concentration would also be candidates for statin treatment. the panel recommended reassessing ldl c measurements after 6 to 12 months of dietary or medication treatment. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 7 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc current clinical practice in the united states rates of dyslipidemia screening in children and adolescents have been historically low. the frequency of lipid testing at well child visits as documented in the national ambulatory medical care survey was 2.5 percent in 1995 and 3.2 percent in 2010.45 claims data from health plans indicate that pharmacologic treatment of 8 to 20 year olds with lipid lowering agents is rare.46 limitations of fixed threshold values for dyslipidemia all recent u.s. clinical guidelines for dyslipidemia screening in youth have relied on fixed thresholds proposed by ncep in 1992. however normal cholesterol concentrations vary with age and sex throughout childhood. thus these cut points tc 200 mg dl and ldl c 130 mg dl may both overidentify and underidentify dyslipidemia in children and adolescents compared with those identified by age and sex specific cut points. two research groups have explored the impact of fixed cut points on prevalence estimates. each group applied lambda mu sigma growth curve methods to nhanes data1 41 and to cross sectional data from the bogalusa heart study the muscatine study the fels longitudinal study and the princeton lipid research clinics study.1 these procedures generated smoothed age and sex specific curves for lipid concentrations for children from preschool through older adolescence.1 41 the curves peak in tc ldl c and hdl c concentrations at ages 8 to 12 years for boys and 7 to 11 years for girls. these curves show that the fixed ncep cut points label many children as abnormal who fall within the 95th percentile in the middle childhood years. at many ages the 90th percentile of the curve for tc exceeds the fixed cut point of 200 mg dl. the 95th percentile for ldl c exceeds the 130 mg dl threshold at almost all ages in fact the 90th percentile for ldl c exceeds the 130 mg dl threshold at many ages.1 ncep and nhanes cut points perform comparably across the adolescent age range.37 previous uspstf recommendation in 2007 the uspstf found insufficient evidence to recommend for or against routine screening for lipid disorders in infants children or adolescents up to age 20 years i statement .34 the 2007 recommendation referred to screening for all forms of dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence and did not include recommendations specific to screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia. the 2007 evidence review found these evidence gaps relevant to screening children and adolescents for multifactorial dyslipidemia data on risk factors that could inform risk based selective screening approaches including overweight and physical inactivity. data from randomized controlled trials rcts on alternative screening strategies and long term followup data sufficient to assess the impact of childhood screening and treatment of dyslipidemia on cardiovascular events in adulthood. long term data on the efficacy and safety of statin treatment and nondrug interventions such as exercise and dietary interventions. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 8 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 2. methods overview this systematic review was designed to complement the systematic review supporting the recommendation on screening for fh in children and adolescents. for this review we adapted the analytic framework for dyslipidemia screening in children used by the 2007 uspstf review to address the benefits and harms of primary care relevant screening and treatment of children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia. multifactorial dyslipidemia as defined above is an elevation in the concentrations of tc or ldl c from causes other than fh. kqs and analytic framework using the uspstf s methods appendix a we developed an analytic framework figure

extend the 2007 systematic review on lipid screening in children. we worked with a trained medical librarian to develop the appropriate search strategy appendix a . our search included results from ahrq bmj clinical evidence canadian agency for drugs and technologies in health cochrane database of systematic reviews database of abstracts of reviews of effects health technology assessment centre for reviews and dissemination institute for clinical systems improvement institute of medicine medline and pubmed and the national institute for health and care excellence. on february 12 2014 we conducted our original search for this review. the search was updated on june 13 2014 and bridge searches were conducted on december 16 2014 and june 2 2015. for the literature published before september 2005 we searched all publications cited in the 2007 uspstf review. although that review did not specifically address diagnostic yield kq3 in this review several of their kqs addressed various aspects of screening. we conducted a focused search of the studies cited in the 2007 uspstf review to identify any that met our criteria for kq3. also because the 2007 uspstf review did not have a kq on the association between screening and intermediate outcomes kq2 in this review or on the association between intermediate outcomes in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia and health outcomes in adulthood kq8 in this review we supplemented our search of the 2007 uspstf citations with a search of the 2011 nhlbi expert panel report39 47 and publications from large published cohort studies with longitudinal data appendix d . to ensure comprehensiveness of our search strategy we reviewed the reference lists of included studies and relevant systematic reviews and meta analyses to identify articles that were not identified in our literature searches. we also supplemented our database searches with suggestions from experts and searched clinicaltrials.gov to identify relevant ongoing trials appendix b . a diagram illustrating our literature search is in appendix a figure 1. study selection two investigators independently reviewed the title and abstracts of all identified articles to determine whether the study met the inclusion and exclusion criteria for design population screening intervention and outcomes appendix a table 1 . two reviewers then independently evaluated 509 full text articles against the complete inclusion and exclusion criteria appendix a table 2 . we resolved discrepancies through discussion and consultation screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 10 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc with a third reviewer. excluded studies and their reason for exclusion are listed in appendix c. for screening studies kqs 1 4 we included studies of asymptomatic persons ages 0 to 20 years at screening. populations already being followed for dyslipidemia or diagnoses associated with secondary dyslipidemia were excluded. eligible screening interventions were defined as a lipid panel fasting or nonfasting lipid measurement tc or ldl c alone or in combination with hdl c delivered in a universal or selective screening strategy. for the diagnostic yield question kq3 we initially required screening studies to include confirmatory testing and subsequent confirmed dyslipidemia. however because of sparse evidence we included studies of large u.s. populations and used single test prevalence to simulate diagnostic yield. we excluded screening studies with modalities not relevant to screening in primary care practice. for treatment studies kqs 5 7 we included interventions using lipid lowering drugs or lifestyle interventions including diet or exercise. we focused on interventions targeting persons ages 0 to 20 years with multifactorial dyslipidemia at the beginning of the intervention. we accepted any class of lipid lowering drug including but not limited to statins and bile acid sequestrants. we excluded studies that focused on treating those with secondary dyslipidemia or monogenic dyslipidemia. we included all reported clinical and laboratory harms associated with all included interventions with evidence of benefit as per kq6. harms associated with interventions for which there was no kq6 evidence were excluded. we included studies with dyslipidemic populations of different causes when outcome data for those with multifactorial dyslipidemia were presented separately. we limited studies of efficacy or effectiveness to fair to good quality studies that were conducted in countries with a united nations human development index score of 0.9 or greater.48 included intervention trials had to compare an intervention against a usual care or control group. consistent with current uspstf methods health outcomes kq1 kq5 and kq8 were defined as those experienced by the patient. we considered the incidence of disease i.e. atherosclerosis or elevated lipid concentrations to be intermediate outcomes kq2 and kq6 . we included trials cohort studies and observational studies that reported clinical or laboratory harms but did not include case series or case reports. quality assessment and data abstraction two reviewers independently appraised all articles that met the inclusion criteria for this review. the appraisal criteria were adapted from the uspstf s design specific quality criteria appendix a table 1 . topic specific quality criteria were designed with the assistance of clinical experts. the final quality rating used in the evidence tables was based on quality guidelines from the procedure manual for uspstf reviews. we rated studies as good fair or poor quality. in general a good quality study met all criteria well. a fair quality study did not meet or did not clearly meet at least one criterion but also had no known issue that would invalidate its results. a poor quality study had limitations that made inferences on a population difficult or unwarranted such as lack of random assignment with biased assignment unclear diagnostic criteria unclear classification procedures or missing baseline characteristics. we screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 11 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc excluded poor quality studies from this review. excluded studies and their reason for exclusion are listed in appendix c. one reviewer extracted data from all included studies rated as fair or good quality into a standard evidence table. a second reviewer checked the data for accuracy. the reviewers abstracted study characteristics e.g. population purpose exposure and outcomes of the study study design elements e.g. recruitment procedures inclusion exclusion criteria duration of followup and attrition rct characteristics e.g. setting blinding methods of measuring outcomes and exposures duration and lipid concentrations outcomes for screening studies e.g. true positives diagnostic yield and ppv intermediate outcomes e.g. lipid concentrations and cimt and health outcomes e.g. mi and stroke and harms. data synthesis and analysis the findings are summarized in tables 3 14. we used the ppv from a study included for kq3 to simulate diagnostic yield in other studies that did not conduct confirmatory testing. for screening studies data on all relevant subgroups are presented. for treatment studies lipid concentrations were expressed as percent change from baseline or difference from baseline. we did not combine data across studies for kq6 because no two included studies used the same treatment. none of the kqs had a sufficient number of included studies to permit meta analysis. expert review and public comment a draft research plan that included the analytic framework kqs and inclusion exclusion criteria was available for public comment from january 23 2014 to february 19 2014. this draft research plan was broadly focused on dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence not specifically on fh. as a result of public comment we decided to conduct two complementary reviews screening for fh and screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents. the final version of the research plan was posted in january 2015. the draft version of this report was reviewed by four invited content experts as well as federal partners from the centers for disease control and prevention centers for medicare medicaid services national institutes of health veteran s health administration and the military health service. we compiled and addressed comments received during this time as appropriate. additionally a draft of the full report was posted on the uspstf s web site from december 22 2015 to january 25 2016. a few comments were received during this public comment period there were no changes made to the report based on these comments. uspstf involvement the authors worked with uspstf liaisons to refine the inclusion criteria address methodological decisions on applicable evidence and resolve issues around scope for the final evidence synthesis. ahrq funded this research under a contract to support the work of the screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 12 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc uspstf. ahrq staff oversaw the project and assisted in external review of the draft evidence report. ahrq was not involved in study selection quality assessment or synthesis. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 13 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 3. results literature search we reviewed 7

fair quality study in a large group practice in ohio met all inclusion criteria.49 this study was also included in the 2007 uspstf review. several screening studies were excluded because they did not conduct confirmatory testing of individuals who screened positive. diagnostic yield is the number of true positive results divided by the total number of individuals screened. this means that individuals screening positive needed to undergo a second test to differentiate true from false positive results. among studies with confirmatory testing several screened children using various definitions of dyslipidemia that did not meet our inclusion criteria such as relying only on nonfasting concentrations using a lower tc threshold in the 170 to 185 mg dl range 50 53 and including elevated triglyceride and decreased hdl c concentrations along with tc and ldl c concentrations in the definition of dyslipidemia.54 screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 14 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc given the dearth of studies meeting our criteria we searched for large recent u.s. studies that reported results of lipid screening using a tc concentration of 200 mg dl or greater an ldl c concentration of 130 mg dl or greater or both on a single occasion. we reviewed several such population based studies that had initially been excluded and chose three to include in this review. these studies provide a population based prevalence of screening yield for elevated tc and ldl c concentrations in children and adolescents in different demographic and risk factor subgroups. in addition to offering contextual information the prevalence of elevated tc concentrations can be combined with the ppv from the older ohio study to compute a simulated diagnostic yield screening yield ppv of the initial screen diagnostic yield. the three included screening studies seven publications using a single lipid test were 1. nhanes. this survey is conducted in consecutive 2 year cycles on a national sample selected with a multistage stratified sampling design. nhanes is designed to produce results representative of the civilian noninstitutionalized u.s. population. four good quality published reports used data from nhanes surveys conducted between 1999 and 2012 to describe the epidemiology of elevated tc and ldl c concentrations in u.s. children and adolescents and among different subgroups.8 15 55 56 2. west virginia cardiac program. two publications report 2003 to 2008 tc and ldl c data from this statewide screening program targeting fifth graders.7 57 3. a retrospective analysis of electronic health records from three large u.s. health systems in california colorado and minnesota reported on the frequency of pediatric lipid screening and also provided data on the prevalence of elevated tc and ldl c concentrations in a sample of almost 30 000 children and adolescents.58 there were no studies that used non hdl c to screen children or adolescents for multifactorial dyslipidemia. all of the included studies were published after the 2007 uspstf review on this topic. included populations the ohio study49 table 6 screened 6 500 3 to 18 year olds mean age 6.4 years receiving care at a large pediatric group practice between 1986 and 1988. no exclusion criteria were stated so the study population may have included children with known primary or secondary dyslipidemia. refusal rate was not reported. the authors described the population as largely white middle class. nhanes is based on a nationally representative sample. the overall response rate among persons selected to take part in nhanes was 77 percent.59 in 2011 to 2012 the survey oversampled asians 30.5 and the 1999 to 2006 data appear to reflect an oversampling of blacks 40.0 and mexican americans 34.4 with whites representing only 25.5 percent of the sample. the four nhanes publications included here focused on overlapping age ranges with the lower limit at ages 6 to 8 years and the upper limit at 17 to 19 years. these publications have partially overlapping populations however only data from nonoverlapping nhanes samples are shown in tables 7 9. individuals were not excluded from analyses for a diagnosis of primary or secondary dyslipidemia. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 15 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc the cardiac study recruited fifth grade students from schools in all 55 west virginia counties. the racial ethnic distribution was 93 percent white 3 percent black 2 percent biracial and less than 1 percent each asian hispanic and other.7 57 no exclusion criteria are stated so the study population may have included children with known primary or secondary dyslipidemia. the health system study included 3 to 19 year olds enrolled in three large health systems in california colorado and minnesota. the racial ethnic distribution for girls was 38.8 percent white 9.9 percent black 6.5 percent asian 19.8 percent hispanic 1.5 percent other and 23.5 percent missing. the distribution for boys was similar. individuals with known primary or secondary dyslipidemia were excluded. all included studies had approximately equal numbers of boys and girls. included interventions the ohio and cardiac studies were designed as population based screening trials both used a universal screening approach. the ohio study drew a nonfasting blood sample from children and adolescents who presented for well child care. those with nonfasting tc concentrations of 200 mg dl or greater were asked to return to the clinic for a fasting lipid profile. an ldl c concentration of 130 mg dl or higher was considered to be elevated. children and adolescents with elevated ldl c received counseling and were referred to a nutritionist. no further workup or diagnostic evaluation for these children is described. in cardiac parents of all fifth grade students in west virginia were asked to participate in a cardiac risk factor assessment including the collection of anthropometric data blood pressure measurements an examination for acanthosis nigricans and a fasting lipid panel including tc ldl c hdl c and triglyceride concentrations. survey staff based in schools disseminated information to parents obtained parent consent and child assent and conducted screenings. parents were asked to complete a five item family history questionnaire about premature chd defined as first or second degree relatives who had experienced mi coronary bypass surgery angioplasty or stent or coronary death before age 55 years. children with tc concentrations of 200 mg dl or greater or with ldl c concentrations of greater than 130 mg dl were considered screen positive. families received a health report with the results of screening interpretations of the findings and followup care recommendations. in contrast to the ohio and cardiac screening trials nhanes and the health system study were designed to determine population based prevalence. thus the actual screening approaches described should not be considered to be directly applicable to primary care settings but the blood tests and cut points are relevant to primary care. nhanes participants were interviewed at home and invited to attend a mobile examination center where they underwent examinations and provided a blood sample. participants of all ages provided nonfasting samples for tc testing. in addition 12 to 19 year olds also provided fasting samples for ldl c testing. all nhanes publications included in this review used the ncep cut points of 200 mg dl for tc and 130 mg dl for ldl c.38 one of the nhanes publications55 also used as cut points the screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 16 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc lipid research clinic s age and sex specific 95th percentile values for tc and ldl c.44 the health system study collected laboratory data on tc and fasting ldl c from laboratory data in the electronic health record. this study also used the ncep cut points. quality four publications from three studies were rated as fair quality7 49 57 58 and four publications from a single study nhanes were rated as good quality.8 15 55 56 the major limitations for the fair quality studies were nongeneralizable populations inappropriately addressed nonindependence of observations and the use of nonfasting lipid concentrations. three articles were excluded for quality 40 for study design issues and 24 for screening method appendix c . overall results and summary of findings the 1989 ohio study used nonfasting tc concentrations to screen children and adolescents universally. at a cut point of 200 mg dl this screening approach had a ppv of 77 percent and a diagnostic yield of 5.8 percent. we then sought more recent estimates of the prevalence of elevated tc concentrations in u.s. children for simulating the expected diagnostic yield of this test. from the literature we identified prevalence estimates for elevated tc concentrations and standard errors ses or confidence intervals cis for the overall population and for relevant subgroups. we applied the ppv of 77 percent and obtained simulated diagnostic yields ranging from 4.8 to 12.3 percent table 9 . detailed results the ohio practice based study the ohio practice based study screened 6 500 children and adolescents presenting for care. the prevalence of elevated nonfasting tc concentrations was 8.5 percent. of these children 88 percent returned for a second screen after 1 to 6 weeks and 77 percent of these had a fasting ldl c concentration of 130 mg dl or greater i.e. ppv of 77 . the diagnostic yield was 5.8 percent. the authors do not report prevalence by subgroups such as age or bmi categories. the ohio study met all our inclusion criteria but it is older and limited to a single pediatric practice. therefore we analyzed three large u.s. studies. all lacked confirmatory testing and so did not report diagnostic yield. however they did provide point estimates and two provided cis of the prevalence of elevated tc in the u.s. population and relevant subgroups. we estimated diagnostic yield by combining these more current estimates of the prevalence of elevated tc with the ppv from the older ohio study. of note these studies report data on the prevalence of both tc and ldl c abnormalities. although the simulation requires tc as the initial test we also present ldl data from these studies here to provide additional context for ldl c elevations. nhanes of the four included nhanes studies three reported the prevalence of elevated tc screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 17 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc concentrations8 15 55 and three on the prevalence of elevated ldl c concentrations.15 55 56 favorable decreasing trends in tc were seen between 1988 and 1994 and between 2011 and 2012.8 15 age and sex specific mean lipid concentrations were consistent with other studies mean tc concentrations varied with age rising from age 3 years until age 8 to 10 years dropping during puberty and then rising again at ages 15 to 17 years.55 this trajectory was similar for both sexes although boys lagged behind girls by 1 to 2 years. the highest rates of elevated tc concentrations by age group were found in ages 9 to 11 years 9.4 and 16 to 19 years 9.4 .15 despite this association with age differences in age specific prevalence of elevated tc concentrations were not statistically significant in any of the nhanes studies table 7 .8 15 55 of the three publications that reported the prevalence of elevated ldl c concentrations two have entirely overlapping samples from the 1999 to 2006 nhanes cycles so we report ldl c data from the one with an analysis of bmi subgroups and exclude the other from table 8.55 favorable trends in ldl c were seen between the 1988 to 1994 survey and the 2007 to 2010 survey.15 the highest age specific rate of elevated ldl c concentrations was reported in 18 to 19 year olds.56 again despite this association with age differences in age specific prevalence were not statistically significant in any of the nhanes studies.15 55 56 the prevalence of elevated ldl c concentrations was significantly greater in children with obesity bmi 95th percentile for age and sex than in healthy weight children prevalence ratio 2.5 95 ci 1.6 to 3.8 . a similar but nonsignificant association was found for overweight children bmi between the 85th and 95th percentile for age and sex prevalence ratio 1.4 95 ci 0.8 to 2.5 table 8 . one of these nhanes studies55 also estimated the number of adolescents who would meet the criteria for pharmacotherapy as recommended by the nhlbi consensus panel that is ldl c concentrations greater than 190 mg dl greater than 160 mg dl with two risk factors or greater than 130 mg dl with diabetes. among 12 to 17 year olds 0.8 percent meet these criteria for lipid lowering medications. of these about half had ldl c concentrations greater than 190 mg dl a concentration consistent with fh.55 the cardiac study the west virginia cardiac study screened 23 263 fifth grade students ages 10 to 11 years statewide between 2003 and 20087 57 for several cardiac risk factors. of all eligible children 24.6 percent had fasting lipid profiles available for analysis. the prevalence of elevated tc concentrations 200 mg dl was 10.7 percent.7 neither of the two publications on this trial reported cis for prevalence estimates. point estimates were 7.5 percent for children with a bmi below the 85th percentile 11.5 percent for overweight children between the 85th and 95th percentiles and 16.0 percent for obese children 95th percentile . elevated ldl c 130 mg dl was reported in 8.7 percent of children.7 a second publication from this same study examined the prevalence of elevated ldl c concentrations in children with and without a family history of premature chd defined as first or second degree relatives who had experienced mi coronary bypass surgery angioplasty or stent or coronary death before age 55 years. point estimates for the prevalence of elevated ldl screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 18 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc c concentrations were 8.3 percent for those with a family history and 9.5 percent for those without tables 7 and 8 .57 the health system study in this retrospective analysis of automated medical records children ages 3 to 19 years with at least one clinic visit in the period from 2007 through 2010 were included.58 out of the initial cohort n 301 080 29 360 9.8 had at least one tc measurement on record. the first tc or ldl c measurement was used in the analyses tables 7 and 8 . the highest point estimates for both tc and ldl c measurements were in 9 to 11 year olds and 17 to 19 year olds compared with 3 to 8 year olds and 12 to 16 year olds. elevated tc concentrations increased with bmi. the percentage of children and adolescents with elevated tc measurements was 10.7 percent in the obese group 8.6 percent in the overweight group and 6.7 percent in the healthy weight group. the 95 cis did not overlap. a similar association was found for ldl c measurements although the cis for overweight and obese children overlapped a little. simulating the prevalence of dyslipidemia combining point estimates of the prevalence of elevated tc concentrations in participants from the nhanes8 15 and cardiac studies7 with the ppv of an initial tc screen derived from the ohio study we simulated a range of diagnostic yields table 9 .49 for this simulation we selected tc estimates from the two nhanes publications that provided the most recent and age specific data. because of the variability across age groups we did not use an overall population estimate. in addition the bmi category specific data from the cardiac study highlighted the greater prevalence of tc elevations in obese children. the highest estimated diagnostic yield was for obese 10 to 11 year olds 12.3 .7 across the age categories reported in the 2007 to 2010 nhanes publication the prevalence and projected diagnostic yield rose and fell reflecting the known biological trajectory of tc.15 kq4. what are harms of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents no studies were identified. kq5. does treatment of

medications in children and adolescents improve intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence description of included studies we included two treatment trials five publications 60 64 one good and one fair quality in children and adolescents with elevated tc and ldl c concentrations table 4 . one of these trials62 was included in the 2007 uspstf childhood dyslipidemia review and one was published in 2013.60 the dietary intervention study in children disc was an rct of a modified ncep step ii diet2 with a multiyear intervention and long term followup. one report of this trial was published after the 2007 review.64 although the disc trial enrolled children with lower ldl c concentrations than stipulated in our inclusion criteria we included it because it is the largest published high quality trial of dietary intervention to lower cholesterol concentrations in children with mild to moderate dyslipidemia. the other trial was a small short term study of a dietary supplement flaxseed in children with moderate to severe dyslipidemia.60 no studies meeting the inclusion criteria evaluated the effect of interventions for childhood dyslipidemia on atherosclerosis outcomes and none evaluated the effect of drugs on intermediate outcomes in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia. no studies meeting the inclusion criteria evaluated interventions targeting primarily hdl c or triglyceride concentrations. included populations the two trials included 32 and 663 participants table 4 . trial participants were drawn from somewhat different age groups. the disc trial included children ages 8 to 10 years whereas the flaxseed trial recruited children ages 8 to 18 years mean 13.2 years standard deviation sd 2.3 years .60 girls and boys were well represented in both trials. the dietary trial was conducted in the united states61 and the other in canada.60 in disc 86.6 percent of participants were white.61 the flaxseed trial did not report race. the disc trial recruited participants by screening asymptomatic children recruited from schools health plans and primary care clinics.61 the flaxseed trial derived its participants from a tertiary care lipid clinic.60 dyslipidemia was defined using elevated fasting lipid concentrations in both trials but the trials differed with regard to degree of dyslipidemia. the flaxseed trial was the only one that met the predetermined inclusion criteria of abnormal ldl c or tc concentrations as defined by the ncep criteria. this trial required children to have elevated fasting serum ldl c concentrations 135 to 193 mg dl on a single occasion. the dietary trial had lower cut points for ldl c and tc values representing mild to moderate elevations.61 as described in the methods section the disc trial was included despite not meeting these inclusion criteria because this large high quality diet trial with good retention and long term followup was likely to provide useful information given the lack of other large studies and the lack of any other dietary trials. in the disc trial asymptomatic children were recruited from primary care sites. lipid concentrations were measured on three occasions and compared to percentiles from the lipid research clinics study.65 children were initially selected on the basis of a nonfasting tc screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 20 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc concentration greater than 175 mg dl. children with fasting ldl c concentrations between the 70th and 99th percentiles for age and sex were offered a second fasting ldl c test at the next visit. children met the dyslipidemia criterion if the average of the two ldl c measurements was between the 80th and 98th percentiles for age and sex. this criterion put many of the disc participants below the ncep definitions of high tc 200 mg dl and ldl c 130 mg dl concentrations. thus the disc trial consisted of children with moderately elevated ldl c concentrations. in addition disc also excluded children with triglyceride concentrations greater than 200 mg dl or hdl c concentrations less than 30 mg dl. the flaxseed trial differed from the disc trial in several other respects. it required participants to have a first degree relative with a history of hypercholesterolemia or premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and participants had to have adhered to the ncep step ii diet for a minimum of 6 months before enrollment. thus these participants had a family history of dyslipidemia and more severe elevations that did not respond to a low fat diet. although not identified as having fh and therefore excluded from the concurrent review on screening for fh 66 these 32 children have a more severe phenotype than those who participated in the disc trial. children and youth with illnesses known to cause secondary hyperlipidemia or taking any lipid lowering medications were excluded from both trials. the disc trial excluded children with any sign of puberty at baseline. the flaxseed trial excluded children with known allergies to flaxseed. mean lipid concentrations in the disc trial were close to the 95th percentile of the lipid research clinics population for this age group in accordance with the studies inclusion criteria. the mean tc and ldl c concentrations were somewhat higher in the flaxseed trial which also included older children so these lipid concentrations represented a greater degree of elevation relative to age specific norms. included interventions the disc trial evaluated a modified ncep step ii diet delivered using a family based counseling approach table 1 . the initial intervention period lasted 3 years. during the first 6 months participants had 11 group visits and two individual family visits. in the subsequent 2.5 year maintenance phase group and individual visits tapered to monthly and then quarterly with monthly telephone contacts in between. parents of control group participants received written educational materials about a heart healthy diet and were informed of their child s baseline cholesterol concentrations. the trial was later extended beyond the initial 3 years and participants in the intervention group continued to receive dietary counseling albeit at a lower intensity for about 8 years.63 finally a subset of female participants was assessed again 9 years after the conclusion of the study during which time no intervention was delivered.64 outcomes were evaluated at 1 3 and 5 years after randomization at the end of the trial about 8 years after randomization and again 9 years after the end of the trial about 17 years after assignment . the flaxseed intervention consisted of 30 g per day of ground flaxseed delivered through specified quantities of specially prepared muffins and bread. the control group received placebo muffins and bread with whole wheat flour instead of flaxseed.60 outcomes were assessed at the screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 21 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc end of the 4 week intervention. quality the flaxseed trial was rated as fair quality60 and the disc trial as good quality.61 64 67 68 the major limitations for the flaxseed study were the small sample size 4 week duration and recruitment from a tertiary care clinic. one trial was excluded for poor quality and 50 studies were excluded for not being rcts appendix c . overall results the two rcts in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia that met our inclusion criteria evaluated different treatments. details from these studies are discussed below table 4 . a low fat dietary counseling intervention lowered mean ldl c and tc concentrations relative to the control group 1 and 3 years later. this effect diminished with time.64 67 a small fair quality trial of flaxseed found no effect on tc or ldl c concentrations after 4 weeks.60 detailed results effect on lipid concentrations one good quality rct evaluated the effect of a modified ncep step ii diet with behavioral counseling to reduce moderately elevated ldl c concentrations in 663 children. mean baseline fasting tc concentration for disc participants was 200 mg dl sd 14.6 mg dl for both the intervention and control groups. mean fasting ldl c concentrations were 130.6 mg dl sd 12.2 mg dl and 130.5 mg dl sd 11.6 mg dl for the intervention and control groups respectively table 10 . mean baseline hdl c and triglyceride concentrations were in the normal range. intervention and control groups were otherwise similar at baseline. this study was initially planned as a 3 year rct with a 6 month intensive intervention phase followed by 2.5 years of a lower intensity maintenance phase. after disc was extended to follow participants to age 18 years intervention and annual assessments continued. youth were last assessed at age 18 years 15.3 or because of funding constraints at a closeout visit before age 18 years 84.7 .63 an additional 19 participants 3 who had initially declined to continue returned for a closeout visit. the age 18 and closeout visits were combined in all analyses and were referred to as last visit or year 7 580 of the original 663 disc participants 87.5 were assessed at year 7. mean age at year 7 was 17.0 years sd 0.91 years .63 retention varied across disc time points ranging from 94.0 percent at year 3 to 78.7 percent at year 5. an ancillary funded study disc06 recruited women who had taken part in disc as children and adolescents to undergo a single assessment 9 years after the end of disc 18 years after randomization . the disc06 followup study examined a series of biomarkers related to breast cancer risk as well as certain metabolic measurements.64 attendance at all study contacts individual and group sessions as well as phone calls was recorded. attendance was highest in the first year with participants attending a mean of 96 screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 22 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc percent of the 19 total contacts. by year 5 attendance had dropped to a mean of 72 percent of about four contacts and in the final year of the initial trial about 8 years after randomization intervention participants attended a mean of 1.3 contacts per year. adherence to dietary recommendations was assessed using a 24 hour dietary recall instrument administered by trained certified dietitians on three nonconsecutive days within 2 weeks of the clinic visit. at baseline dietary intake of cholesterol fat total saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated protein carbohydrate and energy did not differ significantly between groups. mean total fat intake as a percentage of energy intake in the intervention group was 28.5 percent sd 5.8 at year 1 and 28.6 percent sd 5.8 at year 3. these values were both consistent with the recommended fat intake for the disc diet 28 and significantly lower than the mean total fat intake for control subjects of 33.1 percent sd 5.5 at year 1 and 33.0 percent sd 4.7 at year 3 p 0.001 for adjusted mean differences at both time points . mean intake of cholesterol fat subtypes saturated monounsaturated and polyunsaturated and energy was significantly lower in the intervention group than in the control group at year 1 for all measures except polyunsaturated fat and at year 3 for all measures p 0.001 for all adjusted differences except that energy intake at year 1 had p 0.004 and polyunsaturated fat intake at year 3 had p 0.03 . protein and carbohydrate intake was significantly higher in the intervention group than in the control group at both year 1 and year 3 p 0.001 for all adjusted mean differences except that protein intake at year 1 had p 0.001 . to minimize regression to the mean two fasting blood samples were analyzed for lipid concentrations 1 month apart once at baseline and again at year 3. single lipid measurements were obtained at years 1 5 and 7. concentrations of tc hdl c and triglycerides were measured with standard methods and ldl c concentration was calculated. decreases in ldl c and tc relative to the control group were seen in participants randomized to the dietary intervention table 10 figures 2 and 3 . these were statistically significant only at years 1 and 3. the mean adjusted differences between groups were greatest 1 year after randomization 6.1 mg dl for tc and 4.8 mg dl for ldl c p 0.001 and were smaller but still statistically significant at year 3. the groups did not differ significantly at year 5 ldl c and tc year 7 ldl c and tc or year 18 ldl c only . one fair quality double blind 4 week rct evaluated flaxseed supplementation against placebo.60 mean fasting lipid concentrations for participants at baseline were tc of 208 mg dl sd 30 mg dl ldl c of 138 mg dl sd 25 mg dl hdl c of 49 mg dl sd 12 mg dl and triglycerides of 112 mg dl sd 47 mg dl table 11 . differences between intervention and

baked goods with flaxseed or placebo whole wheat . one patient was lost to followup analyses were conducted based on intent to treat. daily logs and an accounting of unconsumed foods revealed a mean of 80 percent sd 18 adherence to the dietary supplement in the placebo group and 85 percent sd 12 in those receiving flaxseed. flaxseed was associated with lower but not statistically significant tc and ldl c concentrations relative to placebo 4 and 5 respectively table 11 . the decrease in hdl c in the intervention group was 15 percent greater than the decrease in the placebo group p 0.001 . the

were too few studies of any one treatment to allow for exploration of heterogeneity or publication bias. kq7. what are the harms of treatment of multifactorial dyslipidemia with lifestyle modifications and or lipid lowering medications in children and adolescents description of included studies one rct the disc trial included in kq6 met all inclusion criteria for assessing potential harms of treating children and adolescents with elevated tc or ldl c concentrations table 4 . this trial yielded five good quality publications with harms data one was published after the 2007 uspstf review.64 also as mentioned above the disc trial was included despite the fact that its ldl c requirement was lower than our inclusion criterion because of its potential contribution to understanding the impact of dietary intervention to lower cholesterol concentrations in children with mild to moderate dyslipidemia. studies reporting on treatments that had at least some evidence of effectiveness were considered for inclusion for kq7. we excluded the flaxseed trial included in kq6 because the intervention had no benefit.60 included populations the disc trial cohort is described above under kq6. included interventions the disc modified ncep step ii diet and family based counseling approach are described above under kq6. assessment of harms the disc participants anthropometric measurements weight height and bmi were assessed at baseline and annually through the final visit in the original study referred to here as year 7 although the actual time after randomization ranged from 6.5 to 9.3 years .63 anthropometrics were measured again at the 2006 2008 followup referred to here as year 18 .64 in addition measurement of skin fold thicknesses in various locations and of mid arm waist and hip circumferences was taken at baseline year 1 and year 3. waist circumference was also measured at year 18. sexual maturation was evaluated at every visit through year 5 or until the participant reached tanner stage 5. age at menarche was recorded for females at year 7 and at screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 24 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc year 18. blood pressure was measured at baseline year 1 year 3 and year 18. serum concentrations measured at baseline year 1 and year 3 consisted of albumin zinc copper ferritin red blood cell folate retinol tocopherol carotenoids vitamin e and hemoglobin. serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase chemistry panel fasting blood glucose and fatty acid distribution in cholesterol esters were also measured at baseline and were scheduled to be measured at either 6 or 24 months however no results were reported past baseline. in addition ferritin folate retinol and zinc were measured at year 7 and blood glucose was measured at year 18. diet was assessed with three random 24 hour dietary recalls at all time points through year 7 to estimate the intake of fats cholesterol protein and carbohydrate. the intake of vitamins a c b6 e and b12 and calcium magnesium phosphorous thiamine niacin riboflavin folate iron and zinc was monitored at these time points to warn of possible deficiencies. psychosocial assessments68 were done at year 3 and included the child behavior checklist internalizing externalizing social competency thought problems anxiety depression and aggression conduct subscales and total score state trait anxiety inventory child depression inventory woodcock johnson psychoeducational battery mathematics and reading achievement and the family environment scale cohesion conflict intellectual cultural orientation moral religious orientation and achievement orientation subscales . medical history collected from parents at baseline and years 1 and 3 included questions about whether a doctor had told them in the past 12 months that their child had anorexia or bulimia and whether the child had expressed suicidal thoughts or behavior. quality the disc trial was rated as good quality. one trial of a dietary intervention was excluded for poor quality69 appendix c . other trials were excluded because they were not rcts. overall results the disc trial revealed no harms of a modified ncep step ii dietary intervention with behavioral counseling in children with multifactorial dyslipidemia. details regarding the different types of harms assessed at the various time points are discussed below table 12 . detailed results the disc trial reported no harms of the dietary intervention at any time point. growth and adiposity were similar in the two study groups at all times 62 63 67 68 with the exception of a lower waist to hip ratio in the intervention group noted at year 1 only.62 mean systolic and diastolic blood pressures did not differ between groups at years 1 and 3. sexual maturation or age of menarche was also similar in both groups through year 7. biochemical analyses including blood micronutrients did not differ between groups with the exception of an unexpected benefit of higher mean retinol concentration in the intervention group at year 3 0.4 g dl greater than control p 0.04 and again at year 7 2.4 g dl greater than control p 0.02 . the difference was screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 25 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc not significant at year 1.63 the only significant difference between groups for nutrient intake was that mean daily zinc intake was lower in the intervention group 0.5 vs. 0.6 mg adjusted mean difference 0.6 mg p 0.03 .62 the adjusted mean difference was no longer significant at year 3 and no other significant differences in intake of vitamins or nutrients were reported at any time period. psychosocial measures at 3 years were largely similar between groups.68 the proportions with elevated scores on the child behavior checklist internalizing and externalizing subscales and on the total behavior problem score were similar as was the proportion with elevated anxiety scores on the state trait anxiety inventory and the proportion with low 25th percentile scores on mathematics and reading performance on the woodcock johnson psychoeducational battery. the only difference in psychosocial outcomes between groups was for depression where the odds ratio of the treatment group was 0.24 95 ci 0.09 to 0.65 for scoring above the cut point indicating depression on the child depression inventory p 0.005 . means of all psychosocial measurements were also compared between groups using linear regression and adjusting for baseline values of age sex household income and number of parents in the household. an interaction term for treatment group sex was entered into separate models. across a large number of comparisons some statistically significant differences were found some favoring the control group and some the intervention group. individual differences between groups were not clinically significant. at the year 18 followup i.e. ages 25 to 29 years the groups did not differ significantly in mean height weight bmi adiposity or reproductive characteristics among the women the men were not included in this followup observational study .64 frequency of metabolic syndrome did not differ between groups. however both systolic blood pressure and fasting plasma glucose concentrations were significantly lower in the treatment group mean systolic blood pressure 107.7 vs. 110.0 mm hg p 0.03 fasting plasma glucose 87.0 vs. 89.1 mg dl p 0.01 . substituting percent body fat obtained by dual energy x ray absorptiometry from 215 participants for bmi in models that included nondietary variables did not materially alter these results. three random nonconsecutive 24 hour dietary recall surveys were collected from each subject and analyzed for intake of sodium calcium potassium and magnesium in addition to analyses of fatty acid fiber and calorie intake nutrient intake was not significantly different between groups although intake of dietary fiber was higher in the intervention group and intake of saturated fatty acids was lower in the intervention group. alcohol intake was significantly higher in the treatment group 4.0 vs. 2.5 drinks week in controls p 0.05 . leisure physical activity in the past year did not differ significantly between groups. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 26 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc kq8. what is the association between intermediate outcomes in childhood and adolescence and future incidence of mi and stroke events in adults included studies one good quality study met the inclusion criteria for kq8 although the sample included adults and children age range 12 to 39 years and data were not reported by age subgroups.70 the aim of the study was to identify any associations between mortality before age 55 years and several cardiovascular risk factors lipid and hemoglobin a1c glycosylated hemoglobin concentrations smoking adiposity and blood pressure. we included this study for its potential to provide useful evidence about the association between elevated tc concentrations in adolescents and young adults and mortality before age 55 years in the absence of any other included evidence. included population this study identified a cohort of 9 245 nhanes participants between 1988 and 1994 who were ages 12 to 39 years at the time of the survey. half the participants were female mean age was 26.1 years se 0.17 years 77.2 percent were non hispanic white 14.7 percent were non hispanic black and 8.1 percent were mexican american. participants whose race ethnicity was classified as something other than these three categories were excluded from analysis. baseline mean tc concentration was 182.0 mg dl se 0.82 mg dl and 28.5 percent of participants had tc concentrations greater than 200 mg dl consisting of 20.9 percent with concentrations between 200 and 239 mg dl and 7.6 percent with concentrations greater than 240 mg dl. included interventions lipid concentrations and baseline data were obtained as per nhanes procedures outlined above as part of kq3. included outcomes outcomes of interest were death before age 55 years from all causes and death before age 55 years from endogenous causes only i.e. from diseases and self inflicted injury but not from accidents or homicides . vital status was assessed using national death index data from 1988 through 2006. the followup period was 12 to 18 years. quality although the included study was of good quality it was considered to provide fair quality evidence for kq8 primarily because its age range was broader than our a priori inclusion criteria and because it is the only included study for kq8. no studies were excluded for poor quality. summary of findings at the end of the study 283 participants 3.1 had died. leading causes of death for the 12 to screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 27 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc 19 year olds were accidents self inflicted injuries circulatory diseases and cancer. proportional hazards models were adjusted for sex race ethnicity and chronic disease status. risk for death before age 55 years was associated with central obesity relative hazard rh 2.39 smoking rh 1.86 and elevated hemoglobin a1c concentrations rh 3.81 . elevated tc concentrations were not significantly associated with an rh for death before age 55 years all causes and endogenous causes when both sexes were included in the same analysis. secondary analyses by sex table 13 found that for females only a very high tc concentration 240 mg dl was associated with a greater risk of death before age 55 years rh 2.58 95 ci 1.31 to 5.08 although a moderately high tc concentration 200 to 239 mg dl did not confer risk rh 0.77 95 ci 0.36 to 1.62 . the authors urge caution in interpreting the finding because it is based on fewer than 90 deaths among female participants. there were no significant associations for males. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 28 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc chapter 4. discussion findings from the systematic review of lipid screening for detecting multifactorial dyslipidemia are discussed here. the reader is reminded that screening for detecting fh is the focus of the companion report. screening summary of evidence we found no direct evidence for the effect of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia on intermediate or health outcomes or on the harms of screening. no rcts tested screening programs for multifactorial dyslipidemia either selective or universal. there is fair evidence that tc screening with a cut point of 200 mg dl has a ppv of 77 percent for multifactorial dyslipidemia. recent nationally representative prevalence estimates suggest a simulated diagnostic yield of 5.4 percent for 8 to 12 year olds and 6.5 percent for 13 to 17 year olds. simulated diagnostic yield ranges between 4 and 12 percent for different age and bmi subgroups. based on large recent u.s. studies the highest diagnostic yield appears to be in obese children 12.3 children ages 9 to 11 years 7.2 and adolescents ages 16 to 19 years 7.2 . the cardiac study was conducted in the same age group that the nhlbi expert panel recommends for universal testing so the diagnostic yields of 5.8 percent 8.9 percent and 12.3 percent for healthy weight overweight and obese 10 to 11 year olds respectively provide reasonable estimates of what might be seen for those subgroups if screening among 9 to 11 year olds was more widely adopted. the prevalence of elevated tc and ldl c concentrations on which diagnostic yields were calculated were consistent across three large recent u.s. studies. the nhanes studies show a gradual decrease in the prevalence of elevated concentrations of tc and ldl c in recent years. however prevalence estimated from a single lipid test overestimates the true prevalence of dyslipidemia because two tests are needed to appropriately classify children according to the ncep ranges of acceptable borderline or high cholesterol concentrations.16 limitations of the body of evidence the fact that only one of the included studies performed confirmatory testing of hypercholesterolemia required that we simulate diagnostic yield. the screening evidence draws heavily from epidemiologic studies rather than screening trials. the prevalence of cholesterol elevations across broad age ranges as is often reported is less meaningful than age group specific rates given the variation of tc concentrations by age. only one school based study7 was relevant to the primary care setting. the use of the fixed ncep thresholds for tc and ldl c concentrations make the prevalence of dyslipidemia and diagnostic yield difficult to determine because these thresholds ignore age and sex variability. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 29 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc there were no studies using non hdl c as a screening test. finally incomplete tracking of lipid concentrations from childhood through adolescence and into adulthood34 is a current limitation of the evidence. multifactorial dyslipidemia detected in persons younger than age 20 years is likely to resolve in young adulthood 37 thus dyslipidemia identified in childhood or adolescence has unclear significance for adult health. evidence gaps there are several gaps in the evidence regarding potential benefit and harms of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia. we found no data on potential benefits of screening such as reducing atherosclerosis. there is a need for screening trials for detection of multifactorial dyslipidemia in childhood and adolescence using both primary and confirmatory testing. many studies were excluded because they used cut points below accepted cut points e.g. an ldl c concentration of 175 or 180 mg dl rather than 200 mg dl . even the accepted fixed 1992 ncep cut points for elevated ldl c and tc concentrations may be inadequate because they may over or underidentify children and adolescents with high tc concentrations depending on age and sex. we found no trials that compared screening universal or selective approaches to no screening. there was also a lack of data on prevalence and diagnostic yield in racially ethnically diverse populations of children. we found no studies of the harms of screening children and adolescents for multifactorial dyslipidemia. the 2007 uspstf review reported that harms of screening for childhood dyslipidemia in general were poorly reported but none of the studies in that review met our criteria. in fact screening for dyslipidemia in children and adolescents has several potential harms. the fixed ncep cut points likely overidentify children in the age groups currently targeted for screening ages 9 to 11 years . even if the 95th percentiles of age and sex adjusted norms for specific populations are used as thresholds up to 5 percent of the population will be identified as having some degree of biochemical abnormality. however dyslipidemia is a risk factor not a disease. the association between elevated tc or ldl c concentrations in youth and current or future disease is unknown. at least some identified individuals may never progress to develop clinically important lipid concentrations or cardiovascular disease. such nondisease could result in subtle harms such as labeling a child as sick or causing parent or child anxiety. in some cases screening may lead to unnecessary or even harmful additional testing and treatment.71 the 2011 nhlbi consensus panel recommends that statin therapy be considered in children age 10 years and older with various combinations of ldl c concentrations exceeding specific cut points family history and risk factors.39 however statins have unknown benefits and harms in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia. in one nhanes study as many as 0.8 percent of adolescents met the nhlbi indications for statin therapy.55 depending on the proportion of children and adolescents with fh among those with elevated ldl c concentrations screening could result in some children and adolescents being started inappropriately on lipid lowering medications. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 30 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc treatment summary of evidence no direct evidence was found for an effect of treatment on health outcomes. this review identified only one rct of a dietary intervention the disc study so the body of evidence is fair at best. this rct provided good quality evidence of a modest effect of dietary counseling for a low fat low cholesterol diet on lowering lipid concentrations in children with mild to moderate dyslipidemia. after 1 year of relatively intensive intervention mean differences between groups compared to baseline were a decrease of 6 mg dl in mean tc and a decrease of 5 mg dl in mean ldl c both differences were statistically significant. both between group differences shrank to about 3 mg dl at year 3 and by year 5 were no longer statistically significant. adherence to the diet during the intervention period was good 62 and there is evidence that the children in the intervention group had improved dietary quality.72 dietary changes made by children in the treatment group in the disc study did not adversely affect their nutritional status growth or development. this finding is consistent with data from the special turku coronary risk factor intervention project which found that a preventive dietary intervention consisting of counseling for a low saturated fat low cholesterol diet begun in infancy had no adverse effect on growth or maturation through age 14 years.73 a small 4 week rct of flaxseed found no effect on tc concentrations. there was no evidence to support any other type of treatment for multifactorial dyslipidemia including nutritional supplements or medications. the 2007 uspstf review included the disc trial but not the more recent flaxseed rct. limitations of the body of evidence the disc trial enrolled children with milder hyperlipidemia making it difficult to generalize results to children with tc concentrations greater than 200 mg dl or ldl c greater than 130 mg dl. this trial also targeted 8 to 10 year olds so the impact of a dietary intervention on adolescents is unknown. the intensity of the counseling intervention limits the generalizability of this treatment to primary care settings where trained nutritional counselors may not be part of the health care team. finally the clinical importance of the small impact on cholesterol concentrations in the 1 to 3 year time frame is unclear. the flaxseed rct included children with a family history of dyslipidemia and although they were not identified as having fh it is possible that some of the participants could have met fh criteria. evidence gaps we found only one high quality rct of dietary intervention for multifactorial dyslipidemia in children. there is a need for other large rcts with long term followup. rigorous trials of screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 31 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc dietary supplements and medications to reduce concentrations of atherogenic lipids in children and adolescents are also lacking. several trials that did not meet our inclusion criteria examined supplements such as psyllium soluble fiber niacin polyunsaturated fatty acid bifidobacterium glucomannan red yeast extract and plant stanols. our search revealed few studies of medications for children or adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia. we excluded a trial of ezetimibe an inhibitor of intestinal cholesterol absorption for lack of a control group74 and found no trials of statins in this population. it should be noted that the current guidelines do not recommend the use of lipid lowering medications to treat multifactorial dyslipidemia in children and adolescents. the treatment studies reviewed for inclusion also relied on various tc and ldl c cut points often below the standard ncep thresholds. few studies followed participants for a year or longer. outcomes summary of evidence a single high quality longitudinal study that included adolescents and young adults from the nhanes found no association between tc concentrations and death before age 55 years when both sexes were combined. the study did find that very high tc concentrations 240 mg dl were significantly associated with premature death in women only although the authors caution that this estimate was based on a small number of deaths. the subgroup of females with tc concentrations greater than 240 mg dl may well be dominated by individuals who have fh for whom premature chd deaths are expected. the importance of this finding is unclear given the small number of deaths in this subgroup. this study was published after the 2007 uspstf review . limitations of the body of evidence in this single included study nhanes outcomes for adolescents were not reported separately from those for young adults. because the 12 to 20 year olds only reached ages 30 to 38 years in the 1988 nhanes survey or 24 to 32 years in the 1994 nhanes survey the findings were weighted toward mortality outcomes for the 21 to 39 year olds. this issue might have been more of a limitation if there had been positive findings. in that case an association for the overall cohort might have been driven by the 20 to 39 year olds. however given the largely negative findings this is only a minor limitation. another limitation is that this study reported all cause and endogenous cause mortality but not cardiovascular mortality an outcome more closely linked to the causal pathway. evidence gaps long term followup studies of pediatric cohorts are needed to better understand the association between cholesterol concentrations in children and adolescents with multifactorial dyslipidemia and adult health outcomes. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 32 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc conclusions we found no direct evidence of effect of tc screening on intermediate or health outcomes. only one study provided a diagnostic yield for tc screening 5.8 . simulated diagnostic yields in data from large u.s. population based studies show variation in tc by age and bmi. there were no studies of the diagnostic yield of selective screening and no studies on the harms of screening. no evidence was found supporting an effect of treatment on health outcomes in adulthood mi and stroke events . dietary counseling may lower tc and ldl c concentrations by 5 to 7 mg dl over 3 years but this intervention was relatively intensive and the effect on lipids dissipated over 5 years. no studies of lipid lowering medications met the inclusion criteria. there is fair evidence of the safety of dietary interventions. in one longitudinal study using nhanes data neither very high nor moderately increased tc concentrations in 12 to 39 year olds was independently associated with death before age 55 years when males and females were combined . research needs include randomized trials of screening strategies with confirmatory testing and longitudinal followup as well as rigorous treatment rcts of promising medications supplements and dietary interventions with long term followup. long term followup studies of pediatric cohorts including racially ethnically diverse cohorts are needed to better establish the long term health risks conferred by elevated tc and ldl c concentrations. although not the focus of this systematic review our findings support a re examination of the commonly accepted fixed ncep threshold tc and ldl c concentrations that define dyslipidemia and a reconsideration of age and sex specific cut points. screening for multifactorial dyslipidemia 33 kaiser permanente research affiliates epc references 1. cook s auinger p huang tt. growth curves for cardio metabolic risk factors in children

disease. a epidemiology of diabetes and chronic kidney disease chronic kidney disease ckd is diag nosed by the persistent presence of elevated urinary albumin excretion al buminuria low estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr or other manifes tations of kidney damage 1 2 . in this section the focus will be on ckd attributed to diabetes diabetic kidney disease which occurs in 20 40 of patients with diabetes 1 3 5 . ckd typ ically develops after diabetes duration of 10 years in type 1 diabetes but may be present at diagnosis of type 2 di abetes. ckd can progress to end stage renal disease esrd requiring dialysis or kidney transplantation and is the leading cause of esrd in the u.s. 6 . in addition among peoplewith type 1 or 2 diabetes the presence of ckd mark edly increases cardiovascular risk and health care costs 7 . assessment of albuminuria and estimated glomerular filtration rate screening for albuminuria can be most easily performed by urinary albumin to creatinine ratio uacr in a random spot urine collection 1 2 . timed or 24 h collections are more burdensome and add little to prediction or accuracy. mea surement of a spot urine sample for albuminalone whetherby immunoassay or by using a sensitive dipstick test specific for albuminuria without simul taneously measuring urine creatinine cr is less expensive but susceptible to false negative and false positive de terminations as a result of variation in urine concentration due to hydration. normal uacr is defined as 30 mg g cr and high urinary albumin excretion is defined as 30mg g cr. however uacr is a continuous measurement and differ ences within the normal and abnormal ranges are associated with renal and cardiovascular outcomes 7 9 . further more because of high biological variabil ity of .20 between measurements in urinary albumin excretion two of three specimens of uacr collected within a 3 to 6 month period should be abnormal before considering a patient to have high or very high albuminuria 1 2 10 11 . exercise within 24 h infection fever congestive heart failure marked hyper glycemia menstruation and marked hypertension may elevate uacr inde pendently of kidney damage 12 . egfr should be calculated from serum creatinine using a validated formula. the chronic kidney disease epidemiology collaboration ckd epi equation is generally preferred 2 . egfr is routinely reported by laboratories with serum creatinine and egfr calculators are available online at nkdep.nih.gov. an egfr persistently 60 ml min 1.73 m2 is considered abnormal though optimal thresholds for clinical diagnosis are de bated in older adults 2 13 . diagnosis of diabetic kidney disease diabetic kidney disease is usually a clin ical diagnosis made based on the pres ence of albuminuria and or reduced egfr in theabsenceof signsor symptoms of other primary causes of kidney dam age. the typical presentation of diabetic kidney disease is considered to include a long standing duration of diabetes ret inopathy albuminuria without gross hematuria and gradually progressive loss of egfr. however signs of ckd may be present at diagnosis or without retinopathy in type 2 diabetes and re duced egfr without albuminuria has been frequently reported in type 1 and type 2 diabetes and is becoming more common over time as the prev alence of diabetes increases in the u.s. 3 4 14 15 . anactive urinary sediment containing red or white blood cells or cellular casts rapidly increasing albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome rapidly decreasing egfr or the absence of retinopathy in type 1 diabetes suggests alternative or additional causes of kidney disease. for patients with these features referral to a nephrologist for further diagnosis in cluding the possibility of kidney biopsy should be considered. it is rare for pa tients with type 1 diabetes to develop kidney disease without retinopathy. in type 2 diabetes retinopathy is onlymod erately sensitive and specific for ckd caused by diabetes as confirmed by kidney biopsy 16 . staging of chronic kidney disease stages 1 2 ckd have been defined by evidence of high albuminuria with s136 microvascular complications and foot care diabetes care volume 43 supplement 1 january 2020 egfr 60ml min 1.73m2 while stages 3 5 ckd have been defined by progres sively lower ranges of egfr 17 fig. 11.1 . at any egfr the degree of albu minuria is associated with risk of cardio vascular disease cvd ckd progression and mortality 7 . therefore kidney disease improving global outcomes kdigo recommends a more compre hensive ckd staging that incorporates albuminuria at all stages of egfr this system is more closely associated with risk but is also more complex and does not translate directly to treatment deci sions 2 . thus based on the current classification system both egfr and albuminuria must be quantified to guide treatment decisions. this is also impor tant since egfr levels are essential to modify drug dosage or restrictions of use fig. 11.1 18 19 . the degree of albu minuria may influence choice of antihy pertensive seesection10 cardiovascular disease and risk management https doi.org.10.2337 dc20 s010 or glucose lowering medications see below . ob served history of egfr loss which is also associated with risk of ckd progression and other adverse health outcomes and cause of kidney damage including possible causes other than diabetes may also affect these decisions 20 . acute kidney injury acute kidney injury aki is diagnosed by a 50 or greater sustained increase in serum creatinine over a short period of time which is also reflected as a rapid decrease in egfr 21 22 . people with diabetes are at higher risk of aki than those without diabetes 23 . other risk factors for aki include preexisting ckd the use of medications that cause kidney injury e.g. nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs and the use of medications that alter renal blood flow and intrarenal hemodynamics. in partic ular many antihypertensive medications e.g. diuretics ace inhibitors and an giotensin receptor blockers arbs can reduce intravascular volume renal blood flow and or glomerular filtration. there was concern that sodium glucose co transporter 2 sglt2 inhibitors may promote aki through volume depletion particularly when combined with diu retics or other medications that reduce glomerular filtration however this has not been found to be true in ran domized clinical outcome trials of ad vanced kidney disease 24 or high cardiovascular disease risk with normal kidney function 25 27 . timely iden tification and treatment of aki is im portant because aki is associated with increased risks of progressive ckd and other poor health outcomes 28 . small elevations in serum creatinine up to 30 from baseline with renin angiotensin system blockers such as ace inhibitors and arbs must not be confused with aki 29 . an analysis of the action to control cardiovascu lar risk in diabetes blood pressure accord bp trial demonstrates that those randomized to intensive blood pressure lowering with up to a 30 increase in serum creatinine did not have any in crease in mortality or progressive kidney disease 30 32

albuminuria and egfr may change due to progression of ckd development of a separate superim posed cause of kidney disease aki or other effects of medications as noted above. serum potassium should also be monitored for patients treated with ace inhibitors arbs and diuretics be cause these medications can cause hy perkalemia or hypokalemia which are associated with cardiovascular risk and mortality 33 35 . for patients with egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 appropriate medication dosing should be verified exposure to nephrotoxins e.g. nonste roidal anti inflammatory drugs and io dinated contrast should be minimized and potential ckd complications should be evaluated table 11.1 . the need for annual quantitative as sessment of albumin excretion after di agnosis of albuminuria institution of ace inhibitors or arb therapy and achiev ing blood pressure control is a subject of debate. continued surveillance can assess both response to therapy and disease progression and may aid in as sessing adherence to ace inhibitor or arb therapy. in addition in clinical trials of ace inhibitors or arb therapy in type 2 diabetes reducing albuminuria from levels 300mg g cr has been associated with improved renal and cardiovascular outcomes leading some to suggest that medications should be titrated to min imize uacr. however this approach has not been formally evaluated in prospec tive trials. in type 1 diabetes remission of albuminuria may occur spontane ously and cohort studies evaluating associations of change in albuminuria with clinical outcomes have reported inconsistent results 36 37 . the prevalence of ckd complications correlates with egfr 38 . when egfr is 60 ml min 1.73 m2 screening for complications of ckd is indicated table 11.1 . early vaccination against hepatitis b virus is indicated in patients likely to progress to esrd see section 4 com prehensive medical evaluation and as sessment of comorbidities https doi .org 10.2337 dc20 s004 for further in formation on immunization . interventions nutrition for people with nondialysis dependent ckd dietary protein intake should be 0.8 g kg body weight per day the recommended daily allowance 1 . compared with higher levels of dietary protein intake this level slowed gfr decline with evidence of a greater effect over time. higher levels of dietary pro tein intake .20 of daily calories from protein or .1.3 g kg day have been associated with increased albuminuria more rapid kidney function loss and cvd mortality and therefore should be avoided. reducing the amount of di etary protein below the recommended daily allowance of 0.8 g kg day is not recommended because it does not alter glycemic measures cardiovascular risk measures or the course of gfr decline 39 . restrictionofdietary sodium to 2 300 mg day may be useful to control blood pressure and reduce cardiovascular risk 40 41 and restriction of dietary potas sium may be necessary to control se rum potassium concentration 23 33 35 . these interventionsmay bemost important for patients with reduced egfr for whom urinary excretion of sodium and potassium may be impaired. for patients on dialysis higher levelsofdietaryprotein intake should be considered since malnutrition is a major problem in some dialysis patients 42 . recommendations for dietary sodium and potassium intake should be individualized on the basis of comorbid conditions med ication use blood pressure and labora tory data. glycemic targets intensive glycemic control with the goal of achieving near normoglycemia has beenshown in largeprospective random ized studies to delay the onset and pro gression of albuminuria and reduced egfr in patients with type 1 diabetes 43 44 and type 2 diabetes 1 45 51 . insulin alone was used to lower blood glucose in the diabetes control and complications trial dcct epidemiol ogy of diabetes interventions and com plications edic study of type 1 diabetes while a variety of agents were used in clinical trials of type 2 diabetes support ing the conclusion that glycemic control itself helps prevent ckd and its progres sion. the effects of glucose lowering therapies on ckd have helped define a1c targets see table 6.2 . the presence of ckd affects the risks and benefits of intensive glycemic con trol and a number of specific glucose lowering medications. in the action to control cardiovascular risk in diabetes accord trial of type 2 diabetes ad verse effects of intensive glycemic con trol hypoglycemia and mortality were increased among patients with kidney disease at baseline 52 53 . moreover there is a lag time of at least 2 years in type 2 diabetes to over 10 years in type 1 diabetes for the effects of intensive glu cose control to manifest as improved egfr outcomes 49 54 55 . therefore in some patients with prevalent ckd and substantial comorbidity target a1c levels may be less intensive 1 56 . table 11.1 selected complications of chronic kidney disease complication medical and laboratory evaluation

renal tubular glucose reabsorption weight systemicbloodpressure intraglomerular pressure and albuminuria and slow gfr loss through mechanisms that appear independent of glycemia 26 57 60 . moreover recent data support the notion that sglt2 inhibitors reduce ox idative stress in the kidney by.50 and blunt increases in angiotensinogen as well as reduce nlrp3 inflammasome activity 61 63 . glucagon like peptide 1 receptor agonists glp 1 ras also have direct effects on the kidney and have been reported to improve renal out comes compared with placebo 64 67 . renal effects should be considered when selecting antihyperglycemia agents see section 9 pharmacologic approaches to glycemic treatment https doi.org 10 .2337 dc20 s009 . selection of glucose lowering medications for patients with chronic kidney disease for patients with type 2 diabetes and established ckd special considerations for the selectionofglucose loweringmed ications include limitations to available medications when egfr is diminished and a desire to mitigate high risks of ckd progression cvd and hypoglycemia 68 69 . drug dosing may require modifi cationwithegfr 60ml min 1.73m2 1 . theu.s. foodanddrugadministration fda revised its guidance for the use of metformin in ckd in 2016 70 recom mending use of egfr instead of serum creatinine to guide treatment and ex panding the pool of patients with kidney disease for whom metformin treatment should be considered. the revised fda guidance states that metformin is contraindicated in patients with an egfr 30ml min 1.73m2 egfr should be monitored while taking metformin the benefits and risks of continuing treatment should be reassessed when egfr falls 45 ml min 1.73 m2 met formin should not be initiated for patients with an egfr 45 ml min 1.73 m2 and metformin should be temporarily discontinued at the time of or before iodinated contrast imag ing procedures in patients with egfr 30 60 ml min 1.73 m2. within these constraints metformin should be con sidered the first line treatment for all patients with type 2 diabetes including those with ckd. sglt2 inhibitors and glp 1 ras should be considered for patients with type 2 diabetes and ckd who require another drug added tometformin to attain target a1cor cannot use or toleratemetformin. sglt2 inhibitors reduce risks of ckd progression cvd events and hypogly cemia. glp 1 ras are suggested because they reduce risks of cvd events and hypoglycemia and appear to possibly slow ckd progression. a number of large cardiovascular out comes trials in patients with type 2 di abetes at high risk for cvd or with existing cvd examined kidney effects as secondary outcomes. these trials include empa reg outcome bi 10773 empagliflozin cardiovascular outcome event trial in type

evaluate cardiovascular and other long term outcomes with semaglutide in subjects with type 2 diabetes 59 64 67 71 . specifically compared with placebo empagliflozin reduced the risk of incident or

renal effects as secondary outcomes. however all of these trials included large numbers of people with stage 3a egfr 45 59 ml min 1.73 m2 kidney disease. in addition subgroup analyses of canvas and leader suggested that the renal benefits of canagliflozin and liraglutide were as great or greater for participants withckdatbaseline 27 66 and incanvas were similar for participants with or with out atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease ascvd at baseline 72 . several large clinical trials of sglt2 inhibitors focused on patients with ad vanced ckd and assessment of primary renal outcomes are completed or ongo ing. canagliflozin and renal end points in diabetes with established nephropa thy clinical evaluation credence a placebo controlled trial of canagliflozin among 4 401 adults with

erage sustained for 30 days by central laboratory assessment or renal death or cardiovascular death was reduced by 30 . this benefit was on background ace inhibitor or arb therapy in.99 of the patients 24 . moreover in this ad vanced ckd group there were clear benefits on cardiovascular outcomes demonstrating a 31 reduction in car diovascular death or heart failure hos pitalization and a 20 reduction in cardiovascular death nonfatal myocar dial infarction or nonfatal stroke 24 74 . in addition to renal effects some sglt2 inhibitors and glp 1 ras have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits. namely in empa regoutcome canvas and leader empagliflozin canagliflozin and liraglutide respectively each reduced cardiovascularevents evaluatedasprimary outcomes compared with placebo see section 10 cardiovascular disease and risk management https doi.org 10 .2337 dc20 s010 for further discussion . while the glucose lowering effects of sglt2 inhibitors are blunted with egfr 45 ml min 1.73 m2 the renal care.diabetesjournals.org microvascular complications and foot care s139 and cardiovascular benefits were still seen down to egfr levels of 30 ml min 1.73 m2 with no significant change in glucose 24 26 43 45 52 56 71 . most participants with ckd in these trials also had diagnosed ascvd at baseline though 28 of canvas participants with ckd did not have diagnosed ascvd 27 . based on evidence from the credence trial and secondary analyses of cardio vascular outcomes trials with sglt2 inhibitors cardiovascular and renal events are reduced with sglt2 inhibitor use in patients down to an egfr of 30 ml min 1.73 m2 even independent of glucose lowering effects 75 . while there is clear cardiovascular risk reduction associated with glp 1 ra use in patients with type 2 diabetes and ckd the proof of benefit on renal outcome will come with the results of the ongoing flow a research study to see how semaglutide works compared to pla cebo in people with type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease trial with injectable semaglutide 76 . as noted above published data address a limited group of ckd patients mostly with coex isting ascvd. renal events have been examined however as both primary and secondary outcomes in published large trials. also adverse event profiles of these agents must be considered. please refer to table 9.1 for drug specific factors including adverse event infor mation for these agents. additional clinical trials focusing on ckd and car diovascular outcomes in ckd patients are ongoing and will be reported in the next few years. for patients with type 2 diabetes and ckd the selection of specific agents may depend on comorbidity and ckd stage. sglt2 inhibitors may be more useful for patients at high risk of ckd progression i.e. with albuminuria or a history of documented egfr loss fig. 9.1 be cause they appear to have large bene ficial effects onckd incidence. the sglt2 inhibitors canagliflozin empagliflozin and dapagliflozin are approved by the fda for use with egfr 45 ml min 1.73 m2 though pivotal trials for each included participants with egfr 30 ml min 1.73 m2 and demonstrated benefit in subgroups with low egfr 26 27 77 . some glp 1 ras may be used with lower egfr but most require dose adjustment. cardiovascular disease and blood pressure hypertension is a strong risk factor for the development and progression of ckd 78 . antihypertensive therapy reduces the risk of albuminuria 79 82 and among patients with type 1 or 2 diabetes with established ckd egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 and uacr 300 mg g cr ace inhibitor or arb therapy reduces the risk of progression to esrd 83 85 . moreover antihypertensive therapy re duces risks of cardiovascular events 79 . blood pressure levels 140 90mmhg are generally recommended to reduce cvd mortality and slow ckd progres sion among all people with diabetes 82 . lower blood pressure targets e.g. 130 80 mmhg should be con sidered for patients based on individual anticipated benefits and risks. patients with ckd are at increased risk of ckd progression particularly those with al buminuria and cvd and therefore may be suitable in some cases for lower blood pressure targets especially in those with 300 mg day albuminuria. ace inhibitors or arbs are the pre ferred first line agent for blood pressure treatment among patients with diabe tes hypertension egfr 60 ml min 1.73 m2 and uacr 300 mg g cr be cause of their proven benefits for pre vention of ckd progression 83 86 . in general ace inhibitors and arbs are considered to have similar benefits 87 88 and risks. in the setting of lower levels of albuminuria 30 299 mg g cr ace inhibitor or arb therapy has been demonstrated to reduce progression to more advanced albuminuria 300mg g cr and cardiovascular events but not progression to esrd 86 89 . while ace inhibitors or arbs are often prescribed for high albuminuria without hyperten sion outcome trials have not been per formed in this setting to determine whether this improves renal outcomes. moreover two long term double blind studies demonstrate no renoprotective effect of either ace inhibitors or arbs in type 1 and type 2 diabetes among those who were normotensive with or without high albuminuria formerly microalbu minuria 90 91 . absent kidney disease ace inhibitors or arbs are useful to control blood pressure but have not proven superior to alternative classes of antihypertensive therapy including thiazide like diuretics and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers 92 . in a trial of people with type 2 diabetes and normal urine albu min excretion an arb reduced or sup pressed the development of albuminuria but increased the rate of cardiovascular events 93 . ina trial ofpeoplewith type1 diabetes exhibiting neither albuminuria nor hypertension ace inhibitors or arbs did not prevent the development of diabetic glomerulopathy assessed by kid ney biopsy 90 this was further sup ported by a similar trial in patients with type 2 diabetes 91 . therefore ace inhibitors or arbs are not recommended for patients without hypertension to pre vent the development of ckd. two clinical trials studied the combi nations of ace inhibitors and arbs and foundnobenefits oncvdor ckd and the drug combination had higher adverse event rates hyperkalemia and or aki 94 95 .therefore thecombineduseoface inhibitors and arbs should be avoided. mineralocorticoid receptor antago nists spironolactone eplerenone and finerenone in combination with ace inhibitors or arbs remain an area of great interest. mineralocorticoid recep tor antagonists are effective for man agementof resistanthypertension have been shown to reduce albuminuria in short term studies of ckd and may have additional cardiovascular benefits 96 98 . there has been however an increase in hyperkalemic episodes in thoseondual therapy and larger longer trials with clinical outcomes are needed before recommending such therapy. referral to a nephrologist consider referral to

patients with type 1 diabe tes may aggravate retinopathy and threaten vision especially when gly cemic control is poor at the time of conception 108 109 . laser photocoagu lation surgery can minimize the risk of vision loss 109 . screening the preventive effects of therapy and the fact that patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy pdr or macular edema may be asymptomatic provide strong support for screening to detect diabetic retinopathy. diabetic retinopathy screening should be performed using validated ap proaches and methodologies. youth with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are also at risk for complications and need to be screened for diabetic retinopathy 110 . if diabetic retinopathy is evident on screening prompt referral to an oph thalmologist is recommended. subse quent examinations for patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes are generally repeated annually for patients with min imal to no retinopathy. exams every 1 2 years may be cost effective after one or more normal eye exams and in a pop ulation with well controlled type 2 di abetes there was essentially no risk of development of significant retinopathy with a 3 year interval after a normal care.diabetesjournals.org microvascular complications and foot care s141 examination 111 . less frequent intervals have been found in simulated modeling to be potentially effective in screening for diabetic retinopathy in patients without diabetic retinopathy 112 .more frequent examinations by the ophthalmologist will be required if retinopathy is progressing. retinal photography with remote reading by experts has great potential to provide screening services in areas where qualified eye care professionals are not readily available 105 106 . high quality fundus photographs can detect most clinically significant diabetic reti nopathy. interpretation of the images should be performed by a trained eye care provider. retinal photography may also enhance efficiency and reduce costs when the expertise of ophthalmol ogists can be used for more complex examinations and for therapy 113 114 . in person exams are still necessary when the retinal photos are of unaccept able quality and for follow up if abnor malities are detected. retinal photos are not a substitute for comprehensive eye exams which should be performed at least initially and at intervals thereafter as recommended by an eye care pro fessional. artificial intelligence systems that detect more than mild diabetic retinopathy and diabetic macular edema authorized for use by the fda represent an alternative to traditional screening approaches 115 . however the bene fits and optimal utilization of this type of screening have yet to be fully de termined. artificial intelligence systems should not be used for patients with known retinopathy prior retinopathy treatment or symptoms of vision impairment. results of eye examina tions should be documented and trans mitted to the referring health care professional. type 1 diabetes because retinopathy is estimated to take at least 5 years to develop after the onset of hyperglycemia patients with type 1 diabetes should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye ex aminationwithin 5 years after the diagnosis of diabetes 116 . type 2 diabetes patients with type 2 diabetes who may have had years of undiagnosed diabetes and have a significant risk of prevalent diabetic retinopathy at the time of di agnosis should have an initial dilated and comprehensive eye examination at the time of diagnosis. pregnancy pregnancy is associated with a rapid progression of diabetic retinopathy 117 118 . women with preexisting type 1 or type 2 diabetes who are plan ning pregnancy or who have become pregnant should be counseled on the risk of development and or progression of diabetic retinopathy. in addition rapid implementation of intensive glycemic management in the setting of retinopa thy is associated with early worsening of retinopathy 109 . women who de velop gestational diabetes mellitus do not require eye examinations during pregnancy and do not appear to be at increased risk of developing diabetic retinopathy during pregnancy 119 . treatment two of the main motivations for screen ing for diabetic retinopathy are to pre vent loss of vision and to intervene with treatment when vision loss can be pre vented or reversed. photocoagulation surgery two large trials the diabetic retinop athy study drs in patients with pdr and the early treatment diabetic ret inopathy study etdrs in patients with macular edema provide the strongest support for the therapeutic benefits of photocoagulation surgery. the drs 120 showed in 1978 that panretinal photocoagulation surgery reduced the risk of severe vision loss from pdr from 15.9 in untreated eyes to 6.4 in treated eyes with the greatest benefit ratio in those withmore advanced base line disease disc neovascularization or vitreous hemorrhage . in 1985 the etdrs also verified the benefits of panretinal photocoagulation for high risk pdr and in older onset patients with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy or less than high risk pdr. panretinal laser photocoagulation is still commonly used to manage compli cations of diabetic retinopathy that in volve retinal neovascularization and its complications. anti vascular endothelial growth factor treatment recent data from the diabetic retinop athy clinical research network and others demonstrate that intravitreal in jections of anti vascular endothelial growth factor anti vegf agent specif ically ranibizumab resulted in visual acu ity outcomes that were not inferior to those observed in patients treated with panretinal laser at 2 years of followup 121 . in addition it was observed that patients treated with ranibizumab tended to have less peripheral visual field loss fewer vitrectomy surgeries for secondary complications from their proliferative disease and a lower risk of developing diabetic macular edema. however a potential drawback in using anti vegf therapy to manage prolifer ative disease is that patients were re quired to have a greater number of visits and received a greater number of treatments than is typically required for management with panretinal laser which may not be optimal for some pa tients. other emerging therapies for retinopathy that may use sustained intra vitreal delivery of pharmacologic agents are currently under investigation. the fda approved ranibizumab for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy in 2017. while the etdrs 122 established the benefit of focal laser photocoagulation surgery in eyes with clinically significant macularedema definedas retinal edema located at or within 500mmof the center of the macula current data from well designed clinical trials demonstrate that intravitreal anti vegf agents provide a more effective treatment regimen for central involved diabeticmacular edema than monotherapy or even combination therapy with laser 123 124 . there are currently three anti vegf agents commonly used to treat eyes with central involved diabetic macular edemadbevacizumab ranibizumab and aflibercept 100 . in both the drs and the etdrs laser photocoagulation surgery was beneficial in reducing the risk of further visual loss in affected patients but generally not beneficial in reversing already dimin ished acuity. anti vegf therapy im proves vision and has replaced the need for laser photocoagulation in the vast majority of patients with di abetic macular edema 125 . most patients require near monthly admin istration of intravitreal therapy with anti vegf agents during the first 12 months of treatment with fewer injec tions needed in subsequent years to maintain remission from central involved diabetic macular edema. s142 microvascular complications and foot care diabetes care volume 43 supplement 1 january 2020 adjunctive therapy lowering blood pressure has been shown to decrease retinopathy progression al though tight targets systolic blood pressure 120 mmhg do not impart additional benefit 106 . ace inhibitors and arbs are both effective treatments in diabetic retinopathy 126 . in patients with dyslipidemia retinopathy progres sion may be slowed by the addition of fenofibrate particularly with very mild nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy at baseline 104 127 . neuropathy screening recommendations 11.25 all patients should be assessed for diabetic peripheral neurop athy starting at diagnosis of type 2 diabetes and 5 years after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes and at least annually thereafter. b 11.26 assessment for distal symmet ric polyneuropathy should include a careful history and assessment of either temper ature or pinprick sensation small fiber function and vi bration sensation using a 128 hz tuning fork for large fiber function . all patients should have annual 10 g monofila ment testing to identify feet at risk for ulceration and am putation. b 11.27 symptoms and signs of auto nomic neuropathy should be assessed in patients with mi crovascular complications. e treatment recommendations 11.28 optimize glucose control to prevent or delay the develop mentofneuropathy inpatients with type 1 diabetes a and to slow the progression of neu ropathy in patients with type 2 diabetes. b 11.29 assess and treat patients to reduce pain related to diabetic peripheral neuropathy b and symptoms of autonomic neu ropathy and to improvequality of life. e 11.30 pregabalin duloxetine or ga bapentin are recommended as initial pharmacologic treat ments for neuropathic pain in diabetes. a the diabetic neuropathies are a hetero geneous group of disorders with diverse clinical manifestations. the early recog nition and appropriate management of neuropathy in the patient with diabetes is important. 1. diabetic neuropathy is a diagnosis of exclusion. nondiabetic neuropathies may be present in patients with di abetes and may be treatable. 2. numerous treatment options exist for symptomatic diabetic neuropathy. 3. up to 50 of diabetic peripheral neu ropathy dpn may be a symptomatic. if not recognized and if preventive foot care is not implemented patients are at risk for injuries to their insensate feet. 4. recognition and treatment of auto nomic neuropathy may improve symptoms reduce sequelae and im prove quality of life. specific treatment for the underlying nerve damage other than improved glycemic control is currently not avail able. glycemic control can effectively prevent dpn and cardiac autonomic neuropathy can in type 1 diabetes 128 129 and may modestly slow their progression in type 2 diabetes 48 but it does not reverse neuronal loss. thera peutic strategies pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic for the relief of pain ful dpn and symptoms of autonomic neuropathy can potentially reduce pain 130 and improve quality of life. diagnosis diabetic peripheral neuropathy patients with type 1 diabetes for 5 ormore years and all patients with type 2 diabetes should be assessed annually for dpn using the medical history and simple clinical tests 130 . symptoms vary ac cording to the class of sensory fibers involved. themost commonearly symp toms are induced by the involvement of small fibers and include pain and dys esthesia unpleasant sensations ofburn ing and tingling . the involvement of large fibers may cause numbness and loss of protective sensation lops . lops indicates the presence of distal sensorimotor polyneuropathy and is a risk factor for diabetic foot ulceration. the following clinical tests may be used to assess small and large fiber function and protective sensation 1. small fiber function pinprick and tem perature sensation 2. large fiber function vibration percep tion and 10 g monofilament 3. protective sensation 10 gmonofilament these tests not only screen for the pres ence of dysfunction but also predict future risk of complications. electrophysiological testing or referral to a neurologist is rarely needed except in situations where the clinical features are atypical or the di agnosis is unclear. in all patients with diabetes and dpn causes of neuropathy other than diabetes should be considered including toxins e.g. alcohol neurotoxic medications e.g. chemotherapy vitamin b12 defi ciency hypothyroidism renal disease malignancies e.g. multiplemyeloma bron chogenic carcinoma infections e.g. hiv chronic inflammatory demyelinat ing neuropathy inherited neuropathies and vasculitis 131 . see the american diabetes association ada position statement diabetic neuropathy for more details 130 . diabetic autonomic neuropathy the symptoms and signs of autonomic neuropathy should be elicited carefully during the history and physical exami nation. major clinical manifestations of diabetic autonomic neuropathy in clude hypoglycemia unawareness rest ing tachycardia orthostatic hypotension gastroparesis constipation diarrhea fe cal incontinence erectile dysfunction neurogenic bladder and sudomotor dys function with either increased or de creased sweating. cardiac autonomic neuropathy. can is associated with mortality independently of other cardiovascular risk factors 132 133 . in its early stages can may be completely asymptomatic and de tected only by decreased heart rate var iability with deep breathing. advanced disease may be associated with resting tachycardia .100 bpm and orthostatic hypotension a fall in systolic or dia stolic blood pressure by .20 mmhg or care.diabetesjournals.org microvascular complications and foot care s143 .10 mmhg respectively upon standing without an appropriate increase in heart rate . can treatment is generally focused on alleviating symptoms. gastrointestinal neuropathies. gastroin testinal neuropathies may involve any portion of the gastrointestinal tract with manifestations including esophageal dysmotility gastroparesis constipation diarrhea and fecal incontinence. gastro paresis should be suspected in individ uals with erratic glycemic control or with upper gastrointestinal symptoms with out another identified cause. exclusionof organic causes of gastric outlet obstruc tion or peptic ulcer disease with esoph agogastroduodenoscopy or a barium study of the stomach is needed before considering a diagnosis of or specialized testing for gastroparesis. the diagnostic gold standard for gastroparesis is the measurement of gastric emptying with scintigraphy of digestible solids at 15 min intervals for 4 h after food intake. the use of 13c octanoic acid breath test is emerging as a viable alternative. genitourinarydisturbances.diabetic auto nomic neuropathy may also cause gen itourinary disturbances including sexual dysfunction and bladder dysfunction. in men diabetic autonomic neuropathy may cause erectile dysfunction and or retrograde ejaculation 130 . female sexual dysfunction occursmore frequently in those with diabetes and presents as decreased sexual desire increased pain during intercourse decreased sexual arousal and inadequate lubrication 134 . lower urinary tract symptoms manifest as urinary incontinence and bladder dysfunction nocturia frequent urination urination urgency and weak urinary stream . evaluation of bladder function should be performed for indi vidualswithdiabeteswhohave recurrent urinary tract infections pyelonephritis incontinence or a palpable bladder. treatment glycemic control near normal glycemic control imple mented early in the course of diabetes has been shown to effectively delay or prevent the development of dpn and can in patients with type 1 diabetes 135 138 . although the evidence for the benefit of near normal glycemic control is not as strong for type 2 di abetes some studies have demonstrated a modest slowing of progression without reversal of neuronal loss 48 139 . specific glucose lowering strategies may have dif ferent effects. in a post hoc analysis par ticipants particularly men in the bypass angioplasty revascularization investigation in type 2 diabetes bari 2d trial treated with insulin sensitizers had a lower inci dence of distal symmetric polyneuropathy over4yearsthanthosetreatedwith insulin sulfonylurea 140 . neuropathic pain neuropathic pain can be severe and can impact quality of life limit mobility and contribute to depression and social dys function 141 . no compelling evidence exists in support of glycemic control or lifestyle management as therapies for neuropathic pain in diabetes or predia betes which leaves only pharmaceutical interventions 142 . pregabalin and duloxetine have re ceived regulatory approval by the fda health canada and the european med icines agency for the treatment of neu ropathic pain in diabetes. the opioid tapentadol has regulatory approval in the u.s. and canada but the evidence of its use is weaker 143 . comparative effectiveness studies and trials that in clude quality of life outcomes are rare so treatment decisions must consider each patient s presentation and comor bidities and often follow a trial and error approach. given the range of partially effective treatment options a tailored and stepwise pharmacologic strategy with careful attention to relative symp tom improvement medication adher ence and medication side effects is recommended to achieve pain reduction and improve quality of life 144 146 . pregabalin a calcium channel a2 d subunit ligand is the most extensively studied drug for dpn. the majority of studies testing pregabalin have reported favorable effects on the proportion of participants with at least 30 50 im provement in pain 143 145 147 150 . however not all trials with pregabalin have been positive 143 145 151 152 especially when treating patients with advanced refractory dpn 149 . adverse effects may be more severe in older patients 153 and may be attenuated by lower starting doses and more gradual titration. the related drug gabapentin has also shown efficacy for pain control in diabetic neuropathy and may be less expensive although it is not fda ap proved for this indication 154 . duloxetine is a selective norepineph rine and serotonin reuptake inhibitor. doses of 60 and 120 mg day showed efficacy in the treatment of pain associ ated with dpn inmulticenter randomized trials although some of these had high drop out rates 143 145 150 152 . duloxetine also appeared to improve neuropathy related quality of life 155 . in longer term studies a small increase in a1cwas reported in people with diabetes treated with duloxetine compared with placebo 156 . adverse events may be more severe in older people but may be attenuated with lower doses and slower titrations of duloxetine. tapentadol is a centrally acting opioid analgesic that exerts its analgesic effects through bothm opioid receptor agonism and noradrenaline reuptake inhibition. extended release tapentadol was ap proved by the fda for the treatment of neuropathic pain associated with diabetes based on data from two mul ticenter clinical trials in which partici pants titrated to an optimal dose of tapentadol were randomly assigned to continue that dose or switch to placebo 157 158 . however both used a design enriched for patients who responded to tapentadol and therefore their results are not generalizable. a recent systematic review and meta analysis by the special interestgrouponneuropathic pain of the international association for the study of pain found the evidence supporting the effectiveness of tapentadol in reducing neuropathic pain to be inconclusive 143 . therefore given the high risk for addiction and safety concerns compared with the relatively modest pain reduction the use of extended release tapentadol is not generally recommended as a first or second line therapy. the use of any opioids for management of chronic neu ropathic pain carries the risk of addiction and should be avoided. tricyclic antidepressants venlafaxine carbamazepine and topical capsaicin although not approved for the treatment of painful dpn may be effective and considered for the treatment of painful dpn 130 143 145 . orthostatic hypotension treating orthostatic hypotension is chal lenging. the therapeutic goal is to min imize postural symptoms rather than s144 microvascular complications and foot care diabetes care volume 43 supplement 1 january 2020 to restore normotension. most patients require both nonpharmacologic mea sures e.g. ensuringadequate salt intake avoiding medications that aggravate hy potension orusingcompressivegarments over the legs and abdomen and phar macologic measures. physical activity and exercise should be encouraged to avoid deconditioning which is known to exac erbate orthostatic intolerance and vol ume repletion with fluids and salt is critical. there have been clinical studies that assessed the impact of an approach incorporating the aforementioned non pharmacologic measures. additionally supine blood pressure tends to be much higher in these patients often re quiring treatment of blood pressure at bedtime with shorter acting drugs that also affect baroreceptor activity such as guanfacine or clonidine shorter acting calcium blockers e.g. isradipine or shorter actingb blockers such as atenolol or metoprolol tartrate. alternatives can include enalapril if patients are unable to tolerate preferred agents 159 161 . midodrine and droxidopa are approved by the fda for the treatment of ortho static hypotension. gastroparesis treatment for diabetic gastroparesis may be very challenging. a low fiber low fat eating plan provided in small frequent meals with a greater propor tion of liquid calories may be useful 162 164 . in addition foods with small particle size may improve key symptoms 165 . withdrawing drugs with adverse effects on gastrointestinal motility including opioids anticholiner gics tricyclic antidepressants glp 1 ras pramlintide and possibly dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors may also im prove intestinal motility 162 166 . in cases of severe gastroparesis pharma cologic interventions are needed. only metoclopramide a prokinetic agent is approved by the fda for the treatment of gastroparesis. however the level of evidence regarding the benefits of me toclopramide for the management of gastroparesis is weak and given the risk for serious adverse effects extrapyra midal signs such as acute dystonic reactions drug induced parkinsonism akathisia and tardive dyskinesia its use in the treatment of gastroparesis beyond 12 weeks is no longer recomm ended by the fda or the european medicines agency. it should be reserved for severe cases that are unresponsive to other therapies 166 . other treatment options include domperidone available outside of the u.s. and erythromycin which is only effective for short term use due to tachyphylaxis 167 168 . gastric electrical stimulation using a surgically implantable device has received approval from the fda although its efficacy is variable and use is limited to patients with severe symptoms that are refractory to other treatments 169 . erectile dysfunction in addition to treatment of hypogonad ism if present treatments for erectile dysfunction may include phosphodies terase type 5 inhibitors intracorporeal or intraurethral prostaglandins vacuum devices or penile prostheses. as with dpn treatments these interventions do not change the underlying pathology and natural history of the disease pro cess but may improve the patient s quality of life. foot care recommendations 11.31 perform a comprehensive foot evaluation at least annually to identify risk factors for ulcers and amputations. b 11.32 patients with evidence of sen sory loss or prior ulceration or amputation should have their feet inspected at every visit. b 11.33 obtain a prior history of ulcer ation amputation charcot foot angioplasty or vascular surgery cigarette smoking retinopathy and renal disease and assess current symptoms of neuropa thy pain burning numbness andvasculardisease legfatigue claudication . b 11.34 the examination should include inspection of the skin assess ment of foot deformities neu rological assessment 10 g monofilament testing with at least one other assessment pinprick temperature vibra tion and vascular assess ment including pulses in the legs and feet. b 11.35 patients with symptoms of claudication or decreased or absent pedal pulses should be referred for ankle brachial index and for further vascular assessment as appropriate. c 11.36 amultidisciplinary approach is recommended for individuals with foot ulcers and high risk feet e.g. dialysis patients and those with charcot foot or prior ulcers or amputation . b 11.37 referpatientswhosmokeorwho have histories of prior lower extremity complications loss of protective sensation structural abnormalities or peripheral arte rial disease to foot care special ists for ongoing preventive care and lifelong surveillance. c 11.38 provide general preventive foot self care education to all patients with diabetes. b 11.39 the use of specialized therapeu tic footwear is recommended for high risk patients with diabetes including thosewith severe neu ropathy foot deformities ulcers callousformation poorperipheral circulation or history of amputa tion. b foot ulcers and amputation which are consequences of diabetic neuropathy and or peripheral arterial disease pad are common and represent major causes of morbidity and mortality in people with diabetes. early recognition and treatment of patients with diabetes and feet at risk for ulcers and amputations can delay or prevent adverse outcomes. the risk of ulcers or amputations is increased in people who have the fol lowing risk factors c poor glycemic control c peripheral neuropathy with lops c cigarette smoking c foot deformities c preulcerative callus or corn c pad c history of foot ulcer c amputation c visual impairment c ckd especially patients on dialysis moreover there is sufficient good quality evidence to support use of ap propriate therapeutic footwear with demonstrated pressure relief that is worn by the patient to prevent plantar care.diabetesjournals.org microvascular complications and foot care s145 foot ulcer recurrence orworsening. how ever there is very little evidence for the use of interventions to prevent a first foot ulcer or heal ischemic infected non plantar or proximal foot ulcers 170 . studies on specific types of footwear demonstrated that shape and barefoot plantar pressure based orthoses were more effective in reducing submeta tarsal head plantar ulcer recurrence than current standard of care orthoses 171 . clinicians are encouraged to review ada screening recommendations for fur ther details and practical descriptions of how to perform components of the com prehensive foot examination 172 . evaluation for loss of protective sensation all adults with diabetes should undergo a comprehensive foot evaluation at least annually. detailed foot assessments may occur more frequently in patients with histories of ulcers or amputations foot deformities insensate feet and pad 173 174 . toassess risk clinicians should ask about history of foot ulcers or am putation neuropathic and peripheral vascular symptoms impaired vision re nal disease tobacco use and foot care practices. a general inspection of skin integrity and musculoskeletal deform ities should be performed. vascular as sessment should include inspection and palpation of pedal pulses. the neurological exam performed as part of the foot examination is designed to identify lops rather than early neu ropathy. the 10 g monofilament is the most useful test to diagnose lops. ideally the 10 g monofilament test should be performed with at least one other assessment pinprick tem perature or vibration sensation using a 128 hz tuning fork or ankle reflexes . absent monofilament sensation sug gests lops while at least two normal tests and no abnormal test rules out lops. evaluation for peripheral arterial disease initial screening for pad should include a history of decreased walking speed leg fatigue claudication and an assessment of the pedal pulses. ankle brachial index testing should be performed in patients with symptoms or signs of pad. addi tionally at least one of the following tests in a patient with a diabetic foot ulcer and peripheral arterial disease should be performed skin perfusion pressure 40 mmhg toe pressure 30mmhg or transcutaneous oxygen pressure tcpo2 25 mmhg . urgent vascular imaging and revascularization should be considered in a patient with a diabetic foot ulcer and an ankle pres sure ankle brachial index 50 mmhg toe pressure 30 mmhg or a tcpo2 25 mmhg 130 175 . patient education all patients with diabetes and partic ularly those with high risk foot condi tions history of ulcer or amputation deformity lops or pad and their families should be provided general education about risk factors and ap propriate management 176 . patients at risk should understand the implica tions of foot deformities lops and pad the proper care of the foot in cluding nail and skin care and the importance of foot monitoring on a daily basis. patients with lops should be educated on ways to substitute other sensory modalities palpation or visual inspection using an unbreak able mirror for surveillance of early foot problems. the selection of appropriate footwear and footwear behaviors at home should also be discussed. patients understand ing of these issues and their physical ability to conduct proper foot surveil lance and care should be assessed. pa tients with visual difficulties physical constraints preventing movement or cognitive problems that impair their abil ity to assess the condition of the foot and to institute appropriate responses will need other people such as family mem bers to assist with their care. treatment people with neuropathy or evidence of increased plantar pressures e.g. ery thema warmth or calluses may be adequately managed with well fitted walking shoes or athletic shoes that cushion the feet and redistribute pres sure. people with bony deformities e.g. hammertoes prominent metatar sal heads bunions may need extra wide or deep shoes. people with bony deformities including charcot foot who cannot be accommodated with com mercial therapeutic footwear will re quire custom molded shoes. special consideration and a thorough workup should be performedwhen patients with neuropathy presentwith the acute onset of a red hot swollen foot or ankle and charcot neuroarthropathy should be ex cluded. early diagnosis and treatment of charcot neuroarthropathy is the best way to prevent deformities that increase the risk of ulceration and amputation. the routine prescription of therapeutic footwear is not generally recommended. however patients should be provided adequate information to aid in selection of appropriate footwear. general foot wear recommendations include a broad and square toe box laces with three or four eyes per side padded tongue qual ity lightweight materials and sufficient size to accommodate a cushioned insole. use of custom therapeutic footwear can help reduce the risk of future foot ulcers in high risk patients 173 176 . most diabetic foot infections are poly microbial with aerobic gram positive cocci. staphylococci and streptococci are the most common causative organ isms. wounds without evidence of soft tissue or bone infection do not require antibiotic therapy. empiric antibiotic therapy can be narrowly targeted at gram positive cocci in many patients with acute infections but those at risk for infection with antibiotic resistant organisms or with chronic previously treated or severe infections require broader spectrum regimens and should be referred to specialized care centers 177 . foot ulcers and wound care may require care by a podiatrist orthopedic or vascular surgeon or rehabilitation specialist experienced in the manage ment of individuals with diabetes 177 . hyperbaric oxygen therapy hbot in patients with diabetic foot ulcers has mixed evidence supporting its use as an adjunctive treatment to enhance wound healing and prevent amputation 178 181 . a well conducted random ized controlled study performed in 103 patients found that hbot did not reduce the indication for amputation or facilitate wound healing compared with comprehensive wound care in patients with chronic diabetic foot ulcers 182 . moreover a systematic review by the international working group on the di abetic foot of interventions to improve the healing of chronic diabetic foot ulcers concluded that analysis of the evidence continues to present methodological s146 microvascular complications and foot care diabetes care volume 43 supplement 1 january 2020 challenges as randomized controlled studies remain few with amajority being of poor quality 179 . thus hbot does not have a significant effect on health related quality of life in patients with diabetic foot ulcers 183 184 . a recent review concluded that the evidence to date remains inconclusive regarding the clinical and cost effectiveness ofhbot as an adjunctive treatment to standard wound care for diabetic foot ulcers 185 . results from the dutch damocles does applying more oxygen cure lower extremity sores trial demon strated that hbot in patients with di abetes and ischemic wounds did not significantly improve complete wound healing and limb salvage 186 . while the centers for medicare medicaid services currently covers hbot for di abetic foot ulcers that have failed a standard course of wound therapy when there are no measurable signs of healing for at least 30 consecutive days 187 given the data not support ing an effect such an approach is not currently warranted. hbot should be a topic of shared decision making before treatment is considered for selected patients with diabetic foot ulcers 187 . references 1. tuttle kr bakris gl bilous rw et al. diabetic kidney disease a report from an ada consensus conference. diabetes care 2014 37 2864 2883
