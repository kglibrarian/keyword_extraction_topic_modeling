    "YAKE! is a light-weight unsupervised automatic keyword extraction method which rests on statistical text features extracted from single documents to select the most relevant keywords of a text. Yake! does not need to be trained on a particular set of documents, nor does it depend on dictionaries, external corpora, text size, language, or domain. \n",
    "\n",
    "YAKE! features to note: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Corpus-Independent: we offer a solution which can retrieve keywords from a single document only, without the need to rely on external document collection statistics as IDF does; i.e., it can be applied to any text.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Domain and Language-Independent: YAKE! works with domains and languages for which there are no ready keyword extraction systems, as it neither requires a training corpus nor depends on sophisticated external sources (such as WordNet or Wikipedia) or linguistic tools (such as NER or PoS taggers) other than a static list of stopwords.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Interior Stopwords: YAKE! can retrieve keywords containing interior stopwords (e.g., “game of Thrones”) with higher precision than the state-of-the-art methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scale: YAKE! scales to any document length linearly in the number of candidate terms identified.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Term Frequency-free: meaning that no conditions are set with respect to the minimum frequency or sentence frequency that a candidate keyword must have. Therefore, based on the features used, a keyword may be considered significant or insignificant with either one occurrence or with multiple occurrences.\n",
    "\n",
    "YAKE! References:\n",

    "* Yake! on Github: <https://github.com/LIAAD/yake/blob/master/tests/test_yake.py>\n",
