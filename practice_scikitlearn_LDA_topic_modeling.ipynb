    "## Topic Modeling using Scikit-Learn's LDA module\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic modeling is a technique for taking some unstructured text and automatically extracting its common themes, it is a great way to get a bird's eye view on a large text collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Scikit-Learn library uses a popular algorithm for doing topic model, namely Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). LDA requires documents to be represented as a bag of words. This representation ignores word ordering in the document but retains information on how many times each word appears.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main distinguishing feature for LDA is it allows for mixed membership, which means that each document can partially belong to several different topics. Note that the vocabulary probability will sum up to 1 for every topic, but often times, words that have lower weights will be truncated from the output."

      "Aggression is an instinctive drive of a person and a dark side of human nature1. It includes a variety of range of \n",
      "behaviors2. Aggression involves verbal and physical assault3, therefore, its expression results in intense violence \n",
      "towards others4. Aggression is an unwanted and maladaptive behavior causing damage and obliteration5. It is \n",
      "exhibited in different forms encompassing physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility6. A person \n",
      "with physical aggression causing physical and emotional harm others while harming or hurting someone verbally is \n",
      "described as verbal aggression. Anger involves physiological activation determining emotional and affective state. \n",
      "Hostility includes feelings of cynicism, mistrust and opposition. With regards to gender difference, research \n",
      "demonstrated men to be more involved in physical violence7. In contrast, women seemed to be more indulged in \n",
      "verbal aggression8. At times, women exhibit passive anger9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial research data highlighted psychological and physical health problems with aggression. It is allied with \n",
      "depression and increased heart rate10,11. In women, anger is related to coronary heart disease12 while anger \n",

      "arthralgia, headaches and peptic ulcer14,15. Aggression is also harmful for social relationship with family and \n",
      "friends16. Anger has negative influence on physical health of women. It causes depression, disturbs quality of life \n",

      "\n",
      "Aggression significantly determines physical health of married women. Previous studies have also noted significant \n",

      "present findings by exemplifying the negative influence of trait displaced aggression on physical health \n",
      "consequences22. Aggressive tendencies influence human physiology. People who face aggression physiologically \n",
      "respond to stressful situation with high activation of sympatho-adrenomedullary system23. That high activation of \n",
      "sympatho-adrenomedullary system is responsible for disturbance in blood flow, gastrointestinal and reproductive \n",
      "organs24. This might be one of the reasons, aggression affecting physical health in women. Anger, too, significantly \n",
      "determined physical health in married women. Literature has demonstrated significant association of anger with \n",
      "diabetes and coronary heart problems25.\n",
      "\n",
      "More anger out or anger expression was robustly associated with health risk behaviors and poor physical health26. \n",
      "In this regard, present findings could be justified while focusing on the emotions involved in anger. A previous study \n",
      "illustrated the direct influence of emotional state on physical health27. With negative emotions, an individual \n",
      "pessimistically perceive a problematic situation and easily gets frustrated. Conversely, optimistic point of view \n",
      "promotes physical health rather than impeding the person's growth. It was further revealed by other research \n",
      "evidence which proved optimism playing a significant predictive role in physical health28. Hence, women with anger \n",
      "and aggressiveness are preoccupied with negativity and pessimism leading to physical distress, discomfort and \n",
      "pain. Two other components of aggression(verbal aggression and hostility) did not significantly determine physical \n",
      "health in married women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verbal aggression, in the present study, was also measured in the form of arguments and disagreements. Women \n",
      "are usually found to be using verbal ability to express whatever they feel and think. Sometimes, it results in verbal \n",
      "arguments, disagreements and illogical discussions. Perhaps for this reason, this variable might not be debilitating \n",

awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics biomedica september monday  biomedical research society all rights  vol no length words  asad r nadeem m christopher m ahmed h awais f and majeed h a  keywords awareness smokers non smokers oral health  the global tobacco epidemic is one of the serious and major public health concerns it causes more than eight million people deaths around the world of these fatalities seven million deaths are occurring due to direct consumption of tobacco while million mortalities of non smokers are the result of passive smoke owing to tobacco consumption low and middle income countries are the most vulnerable countries contributing to the highest morbidity and mortality rates where currently billion i e of the world s smokers resides in addition to the harmful effects of tobacco on health productivity losses and health expenditures are significantly contributing to the overall economic burden of smoking which is estimated to be around us trillion per annum this burden is equivalent to the magnitude of of the global annual gross domestic product gdp developing countries are the main stakeholders of this burden as they borne of this overall economic cost pakistan is among top countries who carries a substantial weight of diseases associated with tobacco worldwide according to the who report established scale of smoking frequency unveiled of pakistan s adult population of men and of women utilizes tobacco in various forms of the tobacco prevalent population of the adult population of men and of women are regular cigarette smokers whereas of the adult population men and women are regular water pipe smokers furthermore men women and of adults practice smokeless tobacco every day as concerns youth population of boys of girls and of youth is consuming tobacco in multiple ways many fatal diseases including respiratory diseases lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are all directly associated with tobacco consumption similarly smoking is more likely to affect the oral well being in several ways emerging from nominal impacts e g teeth discoloring to plausibly hazardous conditions such as oral cancer other conditions include periodontal diseases diminished response to surgical as well as non surgical periodontal treatments pre cancerous lesions and dental transplant collapse the rapid increase in the use of tobacco in pakistan is alarming regardless of confirmed adverse impacts of smoking on health especially on oral wellbeing only few studies assess the awareness of dental patients in the context of pakistan furthermore the dearth of available literature elucidated oral diseases as a center of the research and few has analyzed other aspects of oral wellbeing therefore the objectives of this study were to assess the awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients and to explore the impact of sociodemographics on patient s awareness of these effects  of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics methods the survey was approved by the ethical review committee erc of the hussain college of health sciences hussain memorial hospital lahore no hcsc erc this analytical study was conducted for months between april and february in the six private dental clinics of lahore which is provincial capital of punjab pakistan all patients participated in this study provided written informed consent therefore all patients included in this survey were eighteen years of age or older and visiting for dental procedures in the private dental clinics however study excluded all those patients who did not provide written informed consent the minimum sample size needed to maintain a margin of error confidence interval was calculated as patients using a raosoft sample size calculator by using random sampling technique patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study targeted patients were interviewed by the trained data enumerators by using semi structured questionnaires questionnaire was developed by a multi disciplinary team of authors based on the past reliable and validated scales the survey instrument was pre tested on two groups of patients each to assess various aspects including presentation acceptability and ease of understanding the questionnaire consisted of thirteen questions and was further sub divided into two sections the section wise distribution of variables information is as follows i sociodemographic variables included six questions i e gender female male age of the patient in years marital status single married education in years later transformed into dummy variable high school or less university education average household income in years later transformed into dummy variable pkr or below above pkr and rural background yes no ii smoking status of the dental patients and awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health including seven questions i e current smoking status smoker non smoker smoking and oral health is related yes no smoking effects on oral well being including tooth staining yes no periodontal health yes no caries yes no wound healing yes no and oral cancer yes no scores were calculated for the patient s awareness by assigning yes and no for five effects of smoking on oral health i e periodontal health caries wound healing oral cancer and tooth staining and adding up these scores later data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences software version ibm corp armonk ny usa frequencies percentages and measures of central tendency were calculated for the data differences between non smokers and smokers were assessed regarding patient s socio demographic factors and awareness using chi square test finally multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the impact of sociodemographic factors on the patient s awareness regarding the effects of smoking on oral health significance level p

information of the patients visiting private dental clinics majority of the male patients were smokers as compared to their female counterparts meager proportion of the respondents were unmarried of the patients educational background of the participants was relatively high and up to the university level education however smoker patients were from the same category nearly one fourth of the patients reported monthly household income below the level of pkr and patients had no rural background  scores calculated for the patient s awareness from where patients correctly identified effects of smoking on oral health followed by and effects there was a significant difference between non smokers and smokers according to rural background p educational level of the patients p and gender p but not in marital status or monthly household income  awareness level of dental patients visiting private clinics regarding the effects of tobacco consumption on oral heath according to their smoking status majority of the patients correctly identified oral cancers and caries as serious threat to oral health caused by smoking differences between patient s awareness and most of the effects of smoking on oral health were statistically significant among non smokers and smokers patients  the model fitness was highly significant p gender p educational background of the patients p and monthly household income p were significantly associated with the dental patient s awareness visiting private clinics   smokers were least aware of the adverse impact of smoking on oral health than non smokers scores calculated for the level of awareness unveiled great variations among patients regarding the identification of adverse impacts on oral health triggered by smoking as most of the patients were only able to identify two or threeout of five effects moreover smoker versus non smoker patients were significantly different according to their education gender and rural background also awareness level for the different effects of smoking on oral health including periodontal health caries oral cancer and wound healing was significantly different in smokers versus non smokers furthermore socio demographic factors i e income education and gender were significantly impacting the patient s awareness in current study our results regarding patient s awareness related to negative impact of smoking on oral health among smokers were consistent from those reported by researchers in kuwait the study showed that only one fourth dental patients had full knowledge of these effects similarly dawood and colleagues also reported that smokers had lack of awareness for such effects including male impotency in smokers lung cancers in passive smokers it might be owing to the addiction to smoking which force the smokers to stick with the tobacco consumption irrespective of its hazardous effects on general health and oral wellbeing this justification may also be related to the government of pakistan s initiative which has ensured the compliance of cigarette manufacturers to mention the cautions of smoking hazards on each  of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics and every pack of cigarette in written and pictorial form on the contrary a non smoker perspective may also be inferred which indicates that lack of smoking is directly associated with the awareness of smoking hazards another reason may also be supplemented according to which non smokers being well aware of smoking effects intends to avoid such addictions so they may not encountered with fatal diseases consistent with our work bhatti and colleagues showed that none of the female patients were consuming tobacco in any form as compare to their male counterparts another study elucidated that female as compare to male patients were taking good care of themselves in chronic ill health conditions which shows the female s priority to maintain their health and well being another reason might be linked which explained the gender differences for tobacco consumption is due to the cultural restrictions where such practices consider as unpleasant especially for women contrary to our results a us based study reported that prevalence of smoking among university graduates was less as compared to those having education up to high school level in consistent its present study results sociodemographics including education gender and income were associated with the awareness level of patients regarding smoking hazards to oral health study further showed that females as well as people having higher level of education and higher income were more likely to be aware of such hazards according to a who report smoking is directly linked with the low socioeconomic communities people with low income tend to smoke more than their affluent counterpart and smoking worsened the level of poverty nevertheless our study results didn t support such associations but consistent to saudi study which showed that individuals from affluent families were more likely to smoke cigarettes as compare to those with low socioeconomic backgrounds the argument of economic disadvantage deems to provide an explanation that having lower probability of smoking among unprivileged individuals might be owing to their unaffordability to purchase cigarettes than people from higher income class it is concluded that in a nutshell smoker patients are least aware of the harmful effects of smoking on oral health than non smokers patient awareness concerning such effects is affected by various sociodemographics therefore there is a dire need of further comparative studies involving public healthcare facilities to ensure the validity of inferences drawn from this study limitations the study was self funded and has limited resources in future study may be conducted on large scale to

    "\n",
    "The vectorizer objects provided by Scikit-Learn are quite reliable right out of the box, they allow us to perform all the above steps at once efficiently, and even apply preprocessing and rules regarding the number and frequency of tokens.Count Vectorizer: The most straightforward one, it counts the number of times a token shows up in the document and uses this value as its weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first have to create a CountVectorizer to count the number of words (term frequency), limit your vocabulary size, apply stop words and etc. The CountVectorizer transformer from the sklearn.feature_extraction model has its own internal tokenization and normalization methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it wants the data:** Note the corpus should be a list (which is made of a \"list of strings\" not a \"list of lists\"). CountVectorizer considers each element of the list as a different document to vectorize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected return:** CountVectorizer creates a python dictionary of the tokens and their unique IDs from the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful methods:** \n",
    "* NOTE: cv is the variable I used when creating my CountVectorizer (see code below)\n",
    "* Print the ID of one word in the dictionary: print(cv.vocabulary_.get(u'aspirin'))\n",
    "* Print the list of terms and their unique IDs: print(cv.vocabulary_)\n",
    "* Print the first 50 token IDs: print(list(cv.vocabulary_.keys())[:50])\n",

    "### Fit_Transform \n",
    "Then we will use fit_transform to create a term-document matrix, where each column in the matrix represents a word in the vocabulary while each row represents the document in our dataset where the values in this case are the word counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it wants the data:** Remember that fit_transform() function for Scikit-Learn expects an iterable or list of strings or file objects.\n",
    " \n",
    "**Expected return:** When fit_transform() is called, each individual document is transformed into a sparse array/matrix whose index tuple is the row (the document ID) and the token ID from the dictionary, and whose value is the count.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful methods:**\n",
    "* Check the shape, which should return Number of documents in corpus, Number of terms extracted from corpus: print(word_count_vector.shape) \n",

    "## Topic Modeling with ScikitLearn using LDA\n",
    "\n",
    "Topic Modelling is an unsupervised Machine Learning task where we try to discover “abstract topics” that can describe a collection of documents. For example, let’s say we have a collection of 100 texts. We go through each text and discover that ten of them contain words like “machine learning”, “training”, “supervised”, “unsupervised”, “dataset” and so on. We may not know what these words mean and we really don’t care. We only see a pattern here, that 10% of our articles contain these words and we conclude that they should be included in the same topic. We can’t actually name the topic and again, this is not needed. We are able to cluster these 10 articles into the same topic. And when we get a new text which we have never seen before, we look into it, we find it contains some of these words, then we’ll be able to say “hey, this goes into the same category with the other 10 articles!”\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step is to build an LDA model with scikitlearn. We need to set the number of topics (usually start with 5 to 10 topics) and choose a learning decay state (usually: 0.5, 0.7, or 0.9). Later we will test our LDA model to identify the best number of topics and the setting for learning decay. \n",
    "\n",
    "The LatentDirichletAllocation() function works like this: \n",
    "\n",
    "Assign every word in every document to a temporary topic. This temporary topic will be random at first, but will be updated in the next step.For this step, we will go through every document and then every word in that document and compute 2 values:\n",
    "* the probability that this document belongs to a certain topic; this is based on how many words(except the current word) from this document belong to the topic of the current word\n",
    "* the proportion of documents that are assigned to the topic of the current word because of the current word.\n",
    "\n",
    "This step is completed a certain number of times (established before beginning to run the algorithm). In the end, we will look at each document, find the topic that is most prevalent based on its words and assign that document to that topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it wants the data:** The LDA topic model algorithm requires a document word matrix as the main input. You can create one using CountVectorizer (see steps above to create cv) and the output of the fit_transform, which we called word_count_vector. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Return:** After calling fit_transform on the lda_model, the return is an array which contains a the number of probabilities that our text belongs to each of the number of topics we've asked for. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if there are three numbers for each item in the array, then these 3 numbers are probabilities that our text belongs to one of the 3 topics we’ve generated from the LDA algorithm. We can see that the highest probability(72%) tells us that this text should also belong to the 3rd topic, so in the same topic that talks about cities. We can see that this is a very good result obtained from a very small dataset.\n",
