      " impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients visiting private clinics impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients visiting private clinics biomedica september monday  biomedical research society   vol. no.   asad r. nadeem m. christopher m. ahmed h. awais f. and majeed h.a.   awareness smokers  smokers oral health.  the global tobacco epidemic is one of the serious and major public health concerns. it causes more than eight million people deaths around the world. of these fatalities seven million deaths are occurring due to direct consumption of tobacco while million mortalities of  smokers are the result of passive smoke.owing to tobacco consumption low and middle income countries are the most vulnerable countries contributing to the highest morbidity and mortality rates where currently billion i.e. of the world s smokers resides.in addition to the harmful effects of tobacco on health productivity losses and health expenditures are significantly contributing to the overall economic burden of smoking which is estimated to be around us trillion per annum. this burden is equivalent to the magnitude of of the global annual gross domestic product gdp . developing countries are the main stakeholders of this burden as they borne of this overall economic cost.pakistan is among top countries who carries a substantial weight of diseases associated with tobacco worldwide. according to the who report established scale of smoking frequency unveiled of pakistan s adult population of men and of women utilizes tobacco in various forms. of the tobacco prevalent population of the adult population of men and of women are regular cigarette smokers whereas of the adult population men and women are regular water pipe smokers.furthermore men women and of adults practice smokeless tobacco every day. as concerns youth population of boys of girls and of youth is consuming tobacco in multiple ways.many fatal diseases including respiratory diseases lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are all directly associated with tobacco consumption. similarly smoking is more likely to affect the oral well being in several ways emerging from nominal impacts e.g. teeth discoloring to plausibly hazardous conditions such as oral cancer. other conditions include periodontal diseases diminished response to surgical as well as  surgical periodontal treatments pre cancerous lesions and dental transplant collapse.the rapid increase in the use of tobacco in pakistan is alarming. regardless of confirmed adverse impacts of smoking on health especially on oral wellbeing only few studies assess the awareness of dental patients in the context of pakistan. furthermore the dearth of available literature elucidated oral diseases as a center of the research and few has analyzed other aspects of oral wellbeing. therefore the objectives of this study were to assess the awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients and to explore the impact of sociodemographics on patient s awareness of these effects.  of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients visiting private clinics methods the survey was approved by the ethical review committee erc of the hussain college of health sciences hussain memorial hospital lahore no. hcsc erc . this analytical study was conducted for months between april and february in the six private dental clinics of lahore which is provincial capital of punjab pakistan. all patients participated in this study provided written informed consent. therefore all patients included in this survey were eighteen years of age or older and visiting for dental procedures in the private dental clinics. however study excluded all those patients who did  provide written informed consent. the minimum sample size needed to maintain a margin of error confidence interval was calculated as patients using a raosoft sample size calculator.by using random sampling technique patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study. targeted patients were interviewed by the trained data enumerators by using semi structured questionnaires. questionnaire was developed by a multi disciplinary team of authors based on the past reliable and validated scales.the survey instrument was pre tested on two groups of patients each to assess various aspects including presentation acceptability and ease of understanding. the questionnaire consisted of thirteen questions and was further sub divided into two sections. the section wise distribution of variables information is as follows i. sociodemographic variables included six questions i.e. gender female male age of the patient in years marital status single married education in years later transformed into dummy variable high school or less university education average household income in years later transformed into dummy variable pkr or below above pkr and rural background yes no . ii. smoking status of the dental patients and awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health including seven questions i.e. current smoking status smoker  smoker smoking and oral health is related yes smoking effects on oral well being including tooth staining yes periodontal health yes caries yes wound healing yes and oral cancer yes no . scores were calculated for the patient s awareness by assigning yes and for five effects of smoking on oral health i.e. periodontal health caries wound healing oral cancer and tooth staining and adding up these scores later. data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences software version ibm corp. armonk ny usa . frequencies percentages and measures of central tendency were calculated for the data. differences between  smokers and smokers were assessed regarding patient s socio demographic factors and awareness using chi square test. finally multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the impact of sociodemographic factors on the patient s awareness regarding the effects of smoking on oral health. significance level p value was taken as ..  patient s

male patients were smokers as compared to their female counterparts . meager proportion of the respondents were unmarried. of the patients educational background of the participants was relatively high and up to the university level education however smoker patients were from the same category. nearly one fourth of the patients reported monthly household income below the level of pkr and patients had rural background  . scores calculated for the patient s awareness from where patients correctly identified effects of smoking on oral health followed by and effects. there was a significant difference between  smokers and smokers according to rural background p educational level of the patients p and gender p but  in marital status or monthly household income  . awareness level of dental patients visiting private clinics regarding the effects of tobacco consumption on oral heath according to their smoking status majority of the patients correctly identified oral cancers and caries as serious threat to oral health caused by smoking. differences between patient s awareness and most of the effects of smoking on oral health were statistically significant among  smokers and smokers patients  . the model fitness was highly significant p . gender p educational background of the patients p and monthly household income p were significantly associated with the dental patient s awareness visiting private clinics  .  smokers were least aware of the adverse impact of smoking on oral health than  smokers. scores calculated for the level of awareness unveiled great variations among patients regarding the identification of adverse impacts on oral health triggered by smoking as most of the patients were only able to identify two or threeout of five effects. moreover smoker versus  smoker patients were significantly different according to their education gender and rural background. also awareness level for the different effects of smoking on oral health including periodontal health caries oral cancer and wound healing was significantly different in smokers versus  smokers. furthermore socio demographic factors i.e. income education and gender were significantly impacting the patient s awareness. in current study our results regarding patient s awareness related to negative impact of smoking on oral health among smokers were consistent from those reported by researchers in kuwait. the study showed that only one fourth dental patients had full knowledge of these effects.similarly dawood and colleagues also reported that smokers had lack of awareness for such effects including male impotency in smokers lung cancers in passive smokers .it might be owing to the addiction to smoking which force the smokers to stick with the tobacco consumption irrespective of its hazardous effects on general health and oral wellbeing.this justification may also be related to the government of pakistan s initiative which has ensured the compliance of cigarette manufacturers to mention the cautions of smoking hazards on each  of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients visiting private clinics and every pack of cigarette in written and pictorial form.on the contrary a  smoker perspective may also be inferred which indicates that lack of smoking is directly associated with the awareness of smoking hazards. another reason may also be supplemented according to which  smokers being well aware of smoking effects intends to avoid such addictions so they may  encountered with fatal diseases.consistent with our work bhatti and colleagues showed that none of the female patients were consuming tobacco in any form as compare to their male counterparts.another study elucidated that female as compare to male patients were taking good care of themselves in chronic ill health conditions which shows the female s priority to maintain their health and well being.another reason might be linked which explained the gender differences for tobacco consumption is due to the cultural restrictions where such practices consider as unpleasant especially for women.contrary to our results a us based study reported that prevalence of smoking among university graduates was less as compared to those having education up to high school level .in consistent its present study results sociodemographics including education gender and income were associated with the awareness level of patients regarding smoking hazards to oral health. study further showed that females as well as people having higher level of education and higher income were more likely to be aware of such hazards.according to a who report smoking is directly linked with the low socioeconomic communities.people with low income tend to smoke more than their affluent counterpart and smoking worsened the level of poverty.nevertheless our study results didn t support such associations but consistent to saudi study which showed that individuals from affluent families were more likely to smoke cigarettes as compare to those with low socioeconomic backgrounds. the argument of economic disadvantage deems to provide an explanation that having lower probability of smoking among unprivileged individuals might be owing to their unaffordability to purchase cigarettes than people from higher income class.it is concluded that in a nutshell smoker patients are least aware of the harmful effects of smoking on oral health than  smokers. patient awareness concerning such effects is affected by various sociodemographics. therefore there is a dire need of further comparative studies involving public healthcare facilities to ensure the validity of inferences drawn from this study. limitations the study was self funded and has limited resources. in future study may be conducted on large scale to strengthen its reliability of  drawn about study topic under .

      "the study showed that only one fourth dental patients had full knowledge of these effects.similarly dawood and colleagues also reported that smokers had lack of awareness for such effects including male impotency in smokers lung cancers in passive smokers .it might be owing to the addiction to smoking which force the smokers to stick with the tobacco consumption irrespective of its hazardous effects on general health and oral wellbeing.this justification may also be related to the government of pakistan s initiative which has ensured the compliance of cigarette manufacturers to mention the cautions of smoking hazards on each  of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and  smokers dental patients visiting private clinics and every pack of cigarette in written and pictorial form.on\n",

      "another reason may also be supplemented according to which  smokers being well aware of smoking effects intends to avoid such addictions so they may  encountered with fatal diseases.consistent with our work bhatti and colleagues showed that none of the female patients were consuming tobacco in any form as compare to their male counterparts.another study elucidated that female as compare to male patients were taking good care of themselves in chronic ill health conditions which shows the female s priority to maintain their health and well being.another reason might be linked which explained the gender differences for tobacco consumption is due to the cultural restrictions where such practices consider as unpleasant especially for women.contrary to our results a us based study reported that prevalence of smoking among university graduates was less as compared to those having education up to high school level .in\n",
      "consistent\n",
      "its present study results sociodemographics including education gender and income were associated with the awareness level of patients regarding smoking hazards to oral health.\n",
      "study further showed that females as well as people having higher level of education and higher income were more likely to be aware of such hazards.according to a who report smoking is directly linked with the low socioeconomic communities.people with low income tend to smoke more than their affluent counterpart and smoking worsened the level of poverty.nevertheless our study results didn t support such associations but consistent to saudi study which showed that individuals from affluent families were more likely to smoke cigarettes as compare to those with low socioeconomic backgrounds.\n",
      "the argument of economic disadvantage deems to provide an explanation that having lower probability of smoking among unprivileged individuals might be owing to their unaffordability to purchase cigarettes than people from higher income class.it is concluded that in a nutshell smoker patients are least aware of the harmful effects of smoking on oral health than  smokers.\n",

      "as  shows tangible rewards such as money and in kind gifts are often used to promote cycling together with information that may motivate travellers to change their behaviour such as feedback on past behaviour setting of goals and planning behaviour change and comparing their behaviour with that of others.\n",
      "in addition at least three reviews have been carried out to investigate the effectiveness of such interventions on cycling .\n",
      "nearly all showed positive effects.  \n",
      "of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work the majority of studies which focused on positive interventions in  analysed interventions in field experiments.\n",
      "most of them are general interventions that are the same for everyone  personalised based on historic behaviour and personal needs.\n",
      "this is  the case for travel behaviour change schemes such as described by wen et al.\n",
      "and used in the travelsmart project which provide personalised travel plans and feedback by phone call interview and showed that individualised marketing of interventions helps change travel behaviour in an effective way.\n",
      "however such programs are quite labour intensive and therefore difficult to scale up to large numbers of participants.\n",
      "this may be changing though with the aid of smartphone apps that can automatically detect travel behaviour and provide rewards accordingly such as strava fietstelweek cyclemaps and betterpoints.\n",
      "however so far only used smartphone apps to study the effects of positive incentives on cycling in a field study.\n",
      "similar studies that did  focus on cycling have proven that interventions through mobile technologies can successfully stimulate sustainable travel behaviour e.g. .\n",
      "although field experiments with smartphones can measure behaviour change they also have some drawbacks.\n",
      "they require a lot of commitment from participants.\n",
      "as a result samples are relatively small at most a few hundred respondents and are probably biased due to self selection i.e. participants who are already willing to cycle are more likely to participate.\n",
      "moreover external factors such as weather and events have a strong influence on cycling demand.\n",
      "these factors interfere with the positive incentives.\n",
      "control groups can be used to determine the external effects.\n",
      "in this type of experiment the use of control groups is however quite hard only one study has participants in a control group because there is little incentive for people to participate\n",
      "i.e. there is a burden of using the app but benefits in the form of positive incentives such as rewards.\n",
      "due to these drawbacks it is difficult to make comparisons between incentives or between segments of the population.\n",
      "only the travelsmart project made such comparisons.\n",
      "comparisons between studies are even harder.\n",
      "for example ryley found that a financial incentive of per day would  induce or increase cycle commuting while wardman et al. argued that an incentive of per day can almost double the amount of cycling.\n",
      "it is  clear whether these differences are real or the result of the aforementioned selection and or external effects.\n",
      "furthermore according to some studies in kind gifts can be a good alternative to money .\n",
      "however shaffer and arkes concluded that this is only the case when money and in kind gifts are  offered simultaneously because a direct comparison between  cash and cash incentives makes the fungibility of the cash reward more visible.\n",
      "this study tries to overcome these issues by designing a controlled experiment using a stated intention survey with multiple incentives.\n",
      "respondents got a neutral invitation to participate in a smart mobility experiment without mentioning cycling and the respondents burden is limited.\n",
      "as a result we obtain a relatively large sample and we reduce the self selection bias.\n",
      "to make the experiment as realistic as possible we used mock up apps with which participants could interact as with a real app and we personalised the incentives by including actual travel behaviour of the participants.\n",
      "in doing so we can compare incentives and test which one may be most successful.\n",
      "overall we think that people who never cycle  cyclists may need other incentives to start cycling than people who already cycle but could still cycle more occasional cyclists .\n",
      "we also expect differences between young and older people between highly and lowly educated people and between males and females with the former groups probably more likely to cycle more when positive incentives are provided .\n",
      "in this study we test these assumptions with segmentation analyses that are mostly lacking in other studies.\n",

      "contrary to what we see in the app case and cycle case i.e. where people got to see one mock up app money incentives score significantly better than in kind gifts for the ncg and ocg.\n",

      "male respondents are also more likely to choose gamification over in kind gifts while respondents who care about travel costs talk often about cycling and or have a high education level are more likely to choose gamification rather than reward.\n",
      "it seems that these latter groups are more open to any incentive scheme.\n",
      "from the respondents intention about cycling behaviour change we can see that respondents who are negative about the mock up mostly choose another scheme in the general question while respondents who are positive about the mock scheme tend to stick with this scheme.\n",
      "however there is one notable exception.\n",
      "a significant fraction of respondents who are positive about the in kind gift mock up prefers a social reward scheme and vice versa.\n",
      "this result suggests that in kind and social reward schemes are attractive to the same type of respondent.\n",
      "in contrast there is almost exchange between in kind gifts and money which suggests that these two schemes attract different types of people.  \n",
      "in this study we have examined the potential impact of five positive incentive schemes i.e. social rewards in kind gifts monetary rewards cooperation and competition on commuters cycling behaviour and intention to accept a commuting app.\n",
      "we conducted a study in which these incentive schemes were delivered through a smartphone mock up app as part of a stated preference survey.\n",
      "intervention schemes on the basis of goal setting feedback and rewards had a positive effect on cycling motivation and potential app usage.\n",
      "occasional cyclists were clearly more positive towards the various incentive schemes with about considering one of the mock up schemes than  cyclists with about considering one of the mock up schemes .\n",
      "for the individual schemes in kind gifts and money tangible rewards were most likely to motivate people to cycle more and use the corresponding app.\n",
      "money was the most preferred incentive when respondents chose between alternative incentives but in kind gifts scored better when the mock up apps were considered separately.\n",
      "the latter is in line with the findings of shaffer and arkes but having a web shop associated with in kind gifts may also have made people more enthusiastic about the in kind gift mock up than about the money mock up.\n",
      "we therefore suggest that in kind incentives may be better for cycling promotion as in reality the incentive app will probably provide only one type of reward and the impersonal character of money may partly demotivate e.g. gneezy et al. and shaffer and arkes\n",
      "however the picture is more nuanced as there are differences among the demographic groups.\n",
      "for example men appeared more likely than women to opt for money.\n",
      "travellers who had experiences with related apps tended to consider using the app.\n",
      "for the  cyclists travel related attributes such as travel costs and distance appeared to be important for considering the app.\n",
      "for occasional cyclists and daily cyclists\n",
      "socio demographic and socio economic attributes appeared to be more important.\n",
      "specifically younger and higher educated occasional cyclists and foreign and low income daily cyclists were more likely to use the new app.\n",
      "these results are quite in line what can be expected and also confirm results reported by chorus et al. .  \n",
      "of multinomial logit analysis of the effects of five different app based incentives to encourage cycling to work finally our results suggest that positive incentives may encourage  cyclists to start cycling if distances are short and travel costs are an important consideration in their travel choices.\n",
      "by contrast when  cyclists do  care about travel costs they are most likely to choose reward when asked directly.\n",
      "in other words  cyclists may be encouraged to start cycling when they are made more aware of the travel cost benefits although this may only be true for low income groups.\n",
      "while the attitude towards hard attributes such as travel costs are an important discriminator for behaviour change among  cyclists this is less true for occasional cyclists.\n",
      "they are more likely to change behaviour if they care about attributes related to cycling itself such as safety and whether the cycling is relaxed which is  surprising as they already have experienced cycling.\n",
      "however these are important pre conditions for encouraging cycling.\n",
      "along with that line it is interesting to focus on weather in a future study.\n",
      "bad weather is an important barrier for cycling among occasional cyclists.\n",
      "does the fact that this attribute is important for occasional cyclists to make it more likely for them to change behaviour when they receive incentives or  \n",
      "this is an important question which we can only test in real world situations.\n",
      "regarding the meaningfulness of the observed results one should be careful with drawing  given the study context.\n",
      "respondents were asked about their intentions and did  experience real cycling challenges.\n",
      "inconsistencies between lab and field experiments have been reported in the literature especially when social preferences are involved see list and levitt for an overview .\n",
      "nonetheless even in cases where revealed and stated intention results are  exactly the same some studies e.g. find a clear relation between the two suggesting that relative comparisons within a study are still valid.\n",

      "various cardiovascular incidents reported are all associated with uncontrolled dyslipidemia.surveys conducted in china showed that the incidence of ischemic cvd is significantly reduced by controlling lipid profile among individuals therefore decreasing the mortality and morbidity associated with it .\n",
      "the asymptomatic nature of dyslipidemia is also a concerning issue.\n",
      "hence early screening and preventive measures are equally important in controlling it.a national health and nutrition examination survey was conducted in the united states u.s. from through in which the proportion of the u.s. population with abnormalities in the lipid profile was assessed.\n",
      "in this study it was stated by toth et al.\n",
      "that about percent of u.s. adults have at least one lipid abnormality.a similar survey that took place in china\n",
      "reported that approximately percent of the chinese population was found to have dyslipidemia.these studies reflected the threat dyslipidemia pose on the general health of the population.\n",
      "in our study we have succeeded to show that approximately of young adults had dyslipidemia which is significantly greater than the prevalence described in the above countries.\n",
      "the prevalence of dyslipidemia increases with age however it is essential to note that it also affects younger adults.moreover the process of atherosclerosis starts early in life.\n",
      "a compilation of various observations made by the bogalusa heart study established an association between coronary atherosclerosis and cardiovascular risk factors in young people among which serum ldl and serum triglyceride concentration were a significant factor along with many others therefore young adults with abnormal levels of lipids are at an increased risk of developing cardiovascular complications such as coronary heart disease later in life.\n",
      "considering the lack of literature on dyslipidemias in young adults and its importance in early detection of cardiovascular risks we have highlighted the significance of identifying dyslipidemia in young adults.\n",
      "our study showed that the prevalence of dyslipidemia is higher in females as compared to males.\n",
      "our result is coherent with a cross sectional survey conducted in chongqing china.\n",
      "in this study the prevalence of dyslipidemia in women was as compared to in men.\n",
      "this was primarily due to differences in the frequency of overweight obesity and central obesity.in a study conducted in iran the incidence of dyslipidemia was for males and for females and therefore higher in females which is consistent with the result of our study.however\n",
      "a vast literature provides evidence that the prevalence of dyslipidemia is much higher in men as compared to women.\n",
      "this was shown by a cross sectional study by pan et al.\n",
      "in which the incidence of dyslipidemia was higher in males than in females vs .likewise in the chinese national nutrition and health survey concluded the prevalence of dyslipidemia in chinese adults as and in males and females respectively.moreover a systemic review on dyslipidemia in chinese adults published between and stated that dyslipidemia was more common in men than in women.prior researches\n",
      "have well established that abnormal lipid profile is more prevalent in men as compared to women.this could be due to a higher frequency of cigarette smoking and more consumption of alcohol and high cholesterol food in men.the prevalence of isolated hypercholesterolemia isolated hypertriglyceridemia and isolated low hdl cholesterol in the total population of our study was and respectively.\n",
      "in the study conducted by pan et al.\n",
      "this prevalence was and respectively.extensive surveys in china organized from to revealed that low hdl c and hypertriglyceridemia were\n",
      "the two major types of dyslipidemia in chinese adults.these findings were reinforced in a meta analysis by huang et\n",
      "al.however\n",
      "these trends are different in western countries where high cholesterol and high ldl c were more common forms of dyslipidemia.\n",
      "of prevalence of dyslipidemia in young adults.\n",
      "this was largely due to a high dietary fat and cholesterol intake in american residents.\n",
      "furthermore according to our study isolated low hdl was higher in females as compared to males whereas isolated hypertriglyceridemia was higher in males than females.\n",
      "the results are consistent with the korean national health and nutrition survey in which the large difference in hdl c across six countries was secondary to smoking alcohol consumption age fat intake bmi and educational level.\n",
      "gender difference in hdl c is partly explained by high levels of estrogen in women.\n",
      "this explains the lower mortality rate due to cardiovascular diseases in the female gender.\n",
      "hence hdl c is believed to be protective.the early detection of dyslipidemia is important for implementing management strategies.\n",
      "these strategies can in return reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases that may manifest later in life.\n",
      "certain lifestyle modifications and lipid lowering drugs can be effective on individuals with abnormal lipid profiles.\n",
      "however literature regarding the benefits of early screening and initiation of treatment is sparse.\n",
      "a systematic review in the united states by chou et al. stated that there was prior study that could provide strong evidence for the effects of screening or treatment on clinical outcomes in younger adults.\n",
      "moreover the benefit of early treatment was  clear.\n",
      "therefore trials conducted on a big scale are needed to find evidence for the benefits and harms of dyslipidemia screening or treatment in younger adults.there are some limitations to this study first being that this is a cross sectional study with causal associations between any of the variables.\n",
      "secondly this survey is limited by a small sample size and data collection in a single tertiary care setup.\n",
      "another restriction was that the potential risk factors of dyslipidemia were  taken into consideration.\n",
      "conclusion dyslipidemia being a major risk factor for many systemic diseases should be detected early in life so that effective management is carried out before the start of actual manifestations.\n",
      "this study gave a high prevalence of dyslipidemia in asymptomatic young adults with females being more frequently affected than females.  .\n",

      "these negative dietary patterns are correlated with increased inflammatory markers and insulin resistance in the south asian population.specifically an increase in white rice consumption a staple of the south asian diet has been correlated with an increased risk of type diabetes the same correlation was made with increased consumption of refined grains.high fat and high carbohydrate diets also increase plasma endotoxin levels which by downstream effect increases insulin resistance and inflammatory markers.\n",

      "the consumption of refined sugar and carbohydrates poses a significant threat to the long term health of an increasingly sedentary population with an innate predisposition to type diabetes and metabolic syndrome.\n",
      "recent socioeconomic changes and cultural beliefs within the south asian population have contributed to the amplification of these negative dietary habits and predisposed an entire population to increased prevalence of ascvd.\n",

      "but for almost all of human history individuals have taken to repression of their identities in order to uphold the uniqueness of the group.\n",
      "here the proposition of erving goffman seems valid that the persistent stigmatisation and consequent repression ironically help the sexual minority to foster a sense of identity.\n",

      "in this context dennis altman rightly argues that the hostile reactions against the fostered sense of homosexual identity are temporary because of its transient character.\n",

      "but disclosing one s sexual identity is  as easy a task as it is assumed eliason and schope .\n",

      "however the sexual identity of gays in a more general sense is understood in so many ways the biological sense in terms of gender social manifestations of sex sexual orientation etc gonsiorek and weinrich .\n",
      "but what is common in almost all ways of classifying homosexual identity is the sexuality whether it is mental or emotional biological or social.\n",
      "in this particular context of sexuality michel foucault s analysis holds definite and high ground .\n",
      "he is of the view that sexuality functioned as a sort of essence in western society which emerged in and after the th century.\n",
      "since then sexuality is considered as one of our fundamental truths.\n",
      "he further argued that we do  choose our sexuality.\n",
      "on the contrary it chooses us shapes us makes us who we are and yet remains profoundly other to our rationality and civility.\n",

      "moving further while exploring sexual formations judith butler proposes an account of what she calls the heterosexual matrix which characterises the gender hegemonic model.\n",
      "she emphasises that for bodies to cohere and make sense that there must be a stable sex expressed through a stable gender masculine expresses male feminine expresses female that is oppositionally and hierarchically defined through the contemporary practice of heterosexuality butler .\n",
      "she further argues that gays despite their homosexual identity are  radically outside the heterosexual matrix.\n",
      "to support her stand butler proposes that there are structures of psychic homosexuality within heterosexual relations and structures of psychic heterosexuality within gay and lesbian sexuality and relationships p .\n",
      "for her heterosexuality is  the only expression of power but also the construction of gay and straight sexuality.\n",
      "it would  be wrong to assume that gays who fall in between this heterosexual matrix posed a serious challenge to the binary norms of the gender discourse.\n",
      "interestingly while carrying forward the discourse ken plummer argued that homosexuality is nothing but a social construct developed by the heterosexual majority to restrict and pathologise a sexual minority.\n",
      "he came out with a suggestion that this sexual minority should find acceptance and support from others within the gay world plummer .\n",

      "it is important to recognise that there is a plethora of stage models available to explain the formation and assertion of homosexual minorities most particularly gays coleman .\n",
      "but it is beyond the scope of this article to discuss each of them in exhaustive detail.\n",
      "our aim is to identify their core arguments with marginal reference to the various stages to suit the purpose of this article.\n",
      "vivienne cass s analysis of homosexual identity formation through six stages is one of the most cited works in sexuality studies.\n",
      "she begins with the recognition that the homosexual identity of gays is very much rooted in the culture and history of western society.\n",
      "to her sexual identity evolves out of a clustering of self images which are linked together by the individual s idiosyncratic understanding of what characterises someone as a homosexual p .\n",
      "however after analysing behavioural patterns of homosexual personalities through five socio psychological stages of identity confusion identity comparison identity tolerance identity acceptance and identity pride she finally argues with a positive note that in the sixth stage of identity synthesis the homosexual identity of an individual brings balance and peace as his her identity becomes more acceptable to the heterosexual mainstream and one s sexuality longer remains the central focus of discourse.\n",
      "cass s claim though an exceptional theory is yet to be tested empirically.\n",
      "on the other hand eli coleman after presenting the five stage model pre coming out coming out exploration first relationship and integration argues that the integration of homosexual identity with heterosexuals is  certain.\n",
      "but he proposes that there is every possibility of achieving more compatible relationships with potentially more satisfying social networks in the heterosexual world.\n",
      "in a similar study richard troiden states that sexual identities whether homosexual or heterosexual are  natural but socially learned while interpreting the meaning of sexual feelings to themselves and society in general.\n",
      "after presenting his own five stage model spirals rather than linear sensitisation confusion identity assumption and commitment troiden proposes that despite achieving stable sexual identities individuals may have to remain hidden because of a homophobic social environment.\n",
      "in a sense troiden agrees that the formation of sexual identity is never fully complete to be able to identify oneself with one s sexuality in public spaces and reach self actualisation.\n",
      "however it is seen that theorists pursuing stagist models begin with the default assumption of an individual s heterosexual identity initially which later results in his her full recognition of homosexual identity.\n",
      "the evolution of this sexual identity from the stage of self identification to synthesis into the gay subcultures and away from mainstream culture is imperative.\n",
      "this is how the question of gay cultures and movements and a multicultural outlook in the assertion of homosexual identity comes into force.\n",
      "we do  intend to argue that the formation of sexual identities of the gays is generally the same in all cultural settings of the world.\n",
      "sexual identities are without a doubt culture specific.\n",
      "in experience the formation assertion and recognition of sexual identities varies from culture to culture and across continents.\n",
      "given the cultural variance we have confined our exploration of theoretic frameworks primarily to western society alone.\n",
      "in doing so we do  mean to treat western culture as homogeneous.\n",
      "there are visible subcultural differences within the west which demonstrate completely divergent views on the question of sexual identities.\n",
      "we are also  denying the existence of cultural differences within gays themselves.\n",
      "there are a great variety of categories to which gays may belong.\n",
      "they can be at the same time european english black economist middle class strong believer in human values etc.\n",
      "nevertheless one of the objects of exploring the theoretical construction of the sexual identity of gays is to understand how it actually affects them when assertions along these lines take place.\n",
      "the questions are stark are homosexuals being judged through the yardstick of purity and pollution by the dominant identity that controls mainstream cultural debates\n",
      "are there any disguised or manifest attempts to reinforce the institution of structural violence and discrimination against gays by the dominant heterosexual class to explore the probable answer to these questions we need to explore how untouchability defines the conditions of gays in contemporary times.\n",
      "gays as neo marginalised  of is the gay community\n",
      "the neo marginalised of modern society\n",
      "it is both historically and empirically established that dominant groups often try to reinforce their social values and privileges by stigmatising those whom they wish to exclude.\n",

      "this is also true in the case of gays who are treated as stigmatised individuals.\n",
      "the stigmatised identity of gays has been externally imposed by the normative and coercive institutions of psychiatry and law enforcement valocchi .\n",
      "however given the enormity of stigmatisation and persecution many researchers shifted their attention to understand how gays are responding to their situational dilemma of being unholy stigmatised impure turning them into the neo marginalised of modern society.\n",
      "however the social experiences of gays fit into the frame of goffman s definitional analysis of stigma .\n",
      "gays possess by the hostile propaganda of mainstream heterosexuals enough abnormal attributes to disqualify them as acceptable members of civilised society.\n",

      "it is with the help of these multiple common senses that both classical and contemporaneous mainstream society secured the tacit or manifest licence to habitually tease discriminate harass and ostracise gays berrill .\n",

      "since most of the students do  have enough time motivation accessibility and money to prepare and cook many types of foods\n",
      "thus the foods which are already prepared and given to students in dormitories and universities should possess appropriate quality.\n",
      "it is recommended that more dark green and orange vegetables and legumes dairy and oil be used in students diet.\n",
      "our results for the individual hei components can be compared to the findings of the hei assessment of americans adults.\n",
      "similar to our report those findings showed that americans needed to eat less sodium and more dark green and orange vegetables and legumes whole grains and milk.\n",
      "they also found low scores for calories from sofaas.\n",
      "in contrast the score of calories from sofaas in our research was acceptable.\n",
      "furthermore the mean scores of vegetables and fruits were much higher in kerman and tehran adults than their american peers.\n",
      "this result may be attributed to the higher amount of fruit and vegetables consumed by iranian adults.\n",
      "considering the fact that healthy diets contain more fiber fruit vegetables source of potassium and dairy products source of calcium and becasue there is a correlation between diet quality and these nutrients higher hei total score could be used as a sign of meeting these nutrient requirements.\n",
      "moreover paying attention to each component of this index is also important.\n",
      "previous studies showed that the higher diet quality scores were associated with improved biomarker profiles and reduced chronic disease risk.\n",
      "tande et al found that hei was associated with a lower risk of abdominal obesity in americans.\n",
      "also it was observed that higher hei score was associated with lower bmi and blood pressure in french men.\n",
      "in addition in americans close concordance with dga\n",
      "were associated with favourable changes in hdl cholesterol and blood pressure lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome and limit insulin resistance.  \n",
      "of assessment of the dietary pattern of dormitory students in kerman iran in iranian population\n",
      "more compliance with the dga is associated with the lower prevalence of metabolic syndrome hyperglycaemia and low hdl.\n",
      "obesity metabolic syndrome type diabetes and cardiovascular disease have emerged as epidemiologic public health problems.\n",
      "among the risk factors of these disease special attention should be paid to diet as a controllable environmental factor.\n",
      "therefore inappropriate diet quality of students is of great of concern and the policies adopted by the authorities should be revised in order to perform the required interventions especially with respect to foods given to students at the university and dormitory .\n",
      "nutrition education for students may also be needed to highlight the importance of dairy products and its substitutes oils sodium and good scores for grains and vegetables.\n",
      "one strength of our study was that it was conducted in a developing country under nutrition transition.\n",
      "to the best of our knowledge this is the first study that evaluates the diet quality in dormitory students in iran.\n",
      "another strength was assessing separately each component of the hei in men and women.\n",
      "however  having a standard quantitative dietary index for the iranian populations was a major limitation.\n",
      "american dietary indices eg hei have been previously used in different countries because dietary indices are created based on the previous knowledge of healthful diets and they are applicable to different ethnic groups.\n",
      "the second limitation was the inability to measure the alcoholic beverage intakes as a hei component thus this item was eliminated from the last component.\n",
      "moreover because the iranian fct is incomplete and provides limited data on nutrient content of raw foods and beverages the american fct was used for analyzing the iranian diet.\n",
      "conclusion\n",
      "the results of the present study revealed that the dietary patterns of most dormitory students in kerman were  in accordance with the recommendations of the hei as evident from the finding that indicated around two thirds of this population needs diet quality improvement.\n",
      "the higher compliance with these dietary guidelines was positively associated with healthy lifestyle and better quality of diet in the students in kerman.\n",
      "the unbalanced dietary pattern of the students is a major concern requiring prompt policy revisions and dietary interventions especially in foods that are given to students at the university and dormitory to promote diet quality and prevent  communicable diseases in the future.\n",
      "it seems that nutrition education courses with an emphasis on how to use dairy products whole grains oils and sodium to students can help.\n",
      "strength and limitation one strength of our study was that it was conducted in a developing country under nutrition transition.\n",

      "this correlation has been reported in a previous study in overweight post menopausal women.another study suggests that il may be secreted in relation to the increase in fat deposit resulting in a positive correlation with bmi and total cholesterol.as far as the correlation between smoking and il is concerned a moderate positive correlation between il and smoking load has been demonstrated earlier.one of the probable explanations for this may be that the cigarette smoke activates alveolar macrophages and epithelial cells to release inflammatory mediators leading to increase in the oxidative stress through stimulatory effects on the acute phase response.\n",

      "it must be emphasized however that there is robust evidence to support the use of any galactogogue.metoclopramide in a dose of  tds is often prescribed as a galactogogue.the medication record of the postpartum mother should also be reviewed only those drugs which are safe in lactation should be prescribed.\n",
      "in women with diabetes insulin remains the safest option during lactation.\n",

      "it is also observed that individuals with state anger experience intense anger which may be expressed as a wish to yell at others or to break things.\n",

      "we may conclude that due to this activation of autonomous nervous system they immediately get enraged.\n",

      "moreover this simple definition is easily calculated and thus could be implemented in almost any care setting.\n",
      "as a validation we examined mean prebaseline low density lipoprotein ldl measures stratified by missed appointment rate.\n",
      "we found statistically significant increases in mean ldl with every percent increase in missed appointment rate up to percent at which point the confidence interval for mean ldl crossed the clinically recognized target of  and the increases asymptoted and longer became statistically significant i.e. there were overlaps in the confidence intervals from that point forward .\n",

      "statistical analyses\n",
      "the distance study used a stratified random sampling design that oversampled minority patients to provide adequate power for ethnic contrasts.\n",
      "to account for this design effect we weighted analyses using expansion weights reciprocal of the nonproportional sampling fractions for each ethnic group in all multivariable models.\n",
      "while we had reason to believe that the relationship between ethnicity and pak would be different among survey responders versus nonresponders we opted to address survey nonresponse bias in the analysis as well using the horvitz thompson approach horvitz and source .\n",
      "we first fit a model that predicted response to the distance survey and then created individual weights reciprocal of the probability of the observed response that were used in all multivariable models.\n",
      "we included indicators for explanatory variables with missing survey responses and so as  to violate assumptions of linearity in the multiplicative models categorical variables were used instead of their continuous form.\n",
      "modified poisson regression with a log link function and robust error variance was used to directly estimate relative risk rr zou of african american asian filipino or latino ethnicity relative to caucasians in models of the binary pak outcome.\n",
      "the unit of analysis was the patient.\n",
      "our modeling selection was based on the analysis of a directed acyclic graph dag a visual and rule based approach to capturing the causal relationships in a conceptual framework in this case with regard to the direct causal linkage between ethnicity and pak see appendix s .\n",
      "we used established rules for dags to determine the minimally sufficient covariates needed to estimate the direct effect of ethnicity on pak maldonado and greenland hernan hernandez diaz and robins .\n",
      "we show unadjusted results estimates from a model that controls for confounding by age and gender and estimates from a model that also adjusts for mediators of the ethnicity to pak effect.\n",
      "adjusting for these mediators blocks indirect causal pathways and isolates the independent and direct effect of ethnicity on pak.\n",
      "the mediators included education income assets social support depression employment lep inadequate functional health literacy having an assigned pcp trust in provider medical center age of diabetes onset comorbidity risk score dxcg and competing demands.\n",
      "we also assessed effect modification by testing for interactions between ethnicity and the following age gender and medical center.\n",
      "to evaluate the clinical relevance of pak we modeled postbaseline clinical outcomes using two sets of cutpoints hbalc percent ldl  and sbp mmhg and hbalc percent\n",
      "ldl  and sbp mmhg to determine whether pak was independently associated with poor risk factor control.\n",
      "while the majority percent of clinical measurements was collected after the month observation window we used to determine appointment keeping behavior we ran a sensitivity analysis excluding the small percentage of subjects whose measurements were collected concurrently with the pak measure and found difference in the results.\n",
      "we present analyses from the larger cohort below.\n",
      "a potential shortcoming of our pak measure is that it fails to include same day appointments when they occur with a patient s assigned pcp.\n",
      "our reasoning was same day appointments are motivated by patients health concerns typically to address acute needs whereas planned primary care visits are requested by providers at optimal intervals to ensure sufficient chronic disease monitoring and prevention and are a cornerstone of the pcmh model.\n",
      "however the distinction between same day and planned primary care blurs because medical centers with open access policies and flexible scheduling systems do try to match patients with their pcps for same day appointments and these visits may time permitting include chronic disease monitoring and prevention.\n",
      "to address this concern we conducted a sensitivity analysis using an alternate definition of pak as missing more than one third of all appointments same day or planned with the assigned pcp\n",
      "and we defined same day appointments as only those with providers other than the pcp.\n",
      "another limitation is that a single missed appointment for patients who scheduled less than three appointments would be categorized as pak.\n",

      "in this study we saw a greater propensity among some ethnic groups particularly latinos to use same day appointments and this was strongly predictive of pak rr even after adjusting for disease severity.\n",
      "perceptions of the importance and purpose of planned versus same day primary care appointments may differ between health care providers and patients.\n",
      "some patients may have a preference for using same day services as acute problems arise at the expense of preventive primary care visits.\n",

      "thus time constraints may leave little time to focus on the preventive diabetes care agenda that would dominate a visit planned by the pce as a result patients who are habitually seen at same day rather than planned primary care appointments may receive less preventive care or have less continuity with one pcp thus undermining a personal ongoing patient provider relationship that has been shown to improve glycemic control dearinger wilson and griffith .\n",

      "in addition we have reason to believe that the relationship between ethnicity and pak would be different among survey responders versus nonresponders.\n",
      "given the slightly higher rate of missed appointments in survey nonresponders percent compared with responders percent it is likely that our estimates are conservative and biased toward the null.\n",

      "pak was associated with increased utilization of same day appointments and was also predictive of poor clinical outcomes in a lagged cross sectional analysis.\n",
      "while this study s objective did  include identifying the reasons for ethnic differences in pak we did find that the size of these disparities varied across medical centers.\n",
      "future research needs to evaluate the tension between facility level structural features e.g. providing greater convenience and access via extended hours for same day appointments and missing planned primary care appointments those trade offs may impact ethnic groups differently and perpetuate disparities in unexpected ways.\n",
      "these results may have important implications for public health and health plan policy as managed care settings rapidly expand open access to care supported by the pcmh model rittenhouse and shortell .\n",
      "on an individual level heavier use of same day appointments was associated with higher likelihood of missing planned appointments.\n",

      "said at the annual scientific sessions of the american heart association.\n",
      "this new observation from the national heart lung and blood institute sponsored coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia study carries a hopeful message that has important implications.\n",
      "it suggests that greater public health emphasis should be placed on achieving weight stabilization in young and middle aged adults.\n",
      "that s a more realistic goal for most people than long term maintenance of weight loss according to .\n",
      "lloyd jones of northwestern university chicago.\n",
      "cardia is an ongoing multicenter epidemiologic study of african american and white men and women who were years old at enrollment in . .\n",
      "lloyd jones analysis was restricted to the participants who underwent all six examinations conducted during the first years of follow up.\n",
      "subjects whose  mass index bmi increased by more than kg m from baseline through year that s about\n",
      "a lb weight gain in most people displayed a steady deterioration in all the cardiovascular risk factors measured in the examinations namely triglycerides hdl cholesterol fasting blood glucose and insulin and blood pressure.\n",
      "in contrast participants whose bmi remained steady or rose by more than kg m or who actually lost weight and kept it off had essentially change in their risk factors.\n",
      "for example serum triglycerides in men who maintained a stable bmi rose by an average of just  annually compared with  annually in men whose bmi increased by more than kg m. that sounds like small change\n",
      "but if you take that out for years it means that men who were initially lean but gained weight over the next years increased their triglycerides by points compared with the other men whose triglycerides increased by only points.\n",
      "that s a huge difference at a time when we know atherosclerosis is starting to develop the physician observed.\n",

      "the rate of deterioration in cardiovascular risk factors was largely independent of their baseline bmi.\n",
      "thus cardia participants who were lean as young adults say with a baseline bmi of kg m but who ended up years later with a bmi of kg m experienced roughly the same rate of increase in fasting blood glucose triglycerides and the other risk factors as subjects who started with a bmi of kg m and ended up at kg m. the incidence of metabolic syndrome during the follow up period was among subjects with significant weight gain compared with just in those whose bmi remained stable.\n",
      "one of the most intriguing ancillary findings of cardia was that even though conventional wisdom says that blood pressure increases with age this didn t hold true in study participants who maintained stable  weight.\n",
      "that may be an important observation we need to look at further .\n",
      "lloyd jones said.\n",
      "the bad news to one s surprise is most people find it difficult to avoid significant weight gain as they move from young adulthood toward middle age.\n",

      "the total health care costs attributed to obesity related diseases in were estimated at billion.\n",
      "as a result federal government and state agencies the food and beverage  and health professional organizations are desperately seeking ways to reduce the nation s obesity epidemic.\n",
      "dairy doesn t make you fat experts generally agree that excess energy intake and reduced energy expenditure through less physical activity is responsible for the rise in obesity in the united states.\n",
      "changes in the environment and in individual behavior that tend to encourage over consumption of calories and discourage physical activity are driving forces that account for the increased rate of obesity such as increased availability of energy dense nutrient poor foods and beverages increased portion sizes and increased consumption of meals outside the home.\n",
      "misperceptions about foods and beverages can influence food choices leading to an increase in high calorie nutrient poor diets.\n",
      "for example many individuals who are trying to lose weight eliminate or reduce their intake of dairy foods due to fears about weight gain and misperceptions that milk and other dairy foods are fattening.\n",
      "in a recent survey of respondents indicated that they do  consume dairy foods regularly because they are trying to lose weight.\n",
      "yet numerous studies indicate that recommended intakes of dairy foods are  linked to being overweight or obese.\n",
      "in fact it has been shown that increased dairy consumption is linked with lower weight and  fat.\n",
      "the recent dietary guidelines advisory committee report concluded that there is evidence that consuming the recommended three servings of milk products a day increases  weight.\n",
      "linking weight management with dairy foods the evidence  of understanding the role of dairy foods in weight management a growing  of research has demonstrated that dairy products can help achieve a healthy weight.\n",
      "one of the earliest hints that dairy might affect  weight came from a clinical trial studying calcium s effect on lowering blood pressure in obese african american men with low calcium intakes.\n",
      "the researchers found that increasing low calcium intake to  day by eating two cups of yogurt day without reducing calories for one year unexpectedly reduced  fat by almost lbs.\n",
      "since then numerous but  all studies in humans and animal models have demonstrated enhanced weight and or  fat loss when consuming a calorie reduced diet containing dairy foods calcium in recommended amounts.\n",
      "observational evidence support for dairy foods beneficial role in weight management comes from several observational studies that evaluated the link between calcium dairy intake and  weight.\n",
      "one such study the coronary artery risk development in young adults cardia followed adults for years.\n",
      "among overweight and obese adults the obesity occurrence and weight gain risk over years was lower in those consuming the most dairy foods versus those consuming the least.\n",
      "neither the type of dairy product  its fat content affected the study results.\n",
      "the quebec family study of nearly adults reported that women who consumed less than  calcium per day had greater  weight and  fat than women who consumed more than  calcium per day.\n",
      "a similar pattern was observed for  fat in men.\n",
      "most studies in children and adolescents have also shown either inverse or neutral associations between calcium dairy foods and  weight and fat.\n",
      "to date the majority of observational and clinical studies support a beneficial relationship between dairy food intake and lower  weight and  fat.\n",
      "the failure of some studies to support this association may be explained by factors such as high baseline calcium intakes lack of control of energy intakes and or use of normal weight subjects.\n",
      "clinical evidence the first clinical study directly demonstrating that increasing calcium intake from low to recommended levels through dairy foods can accelerate  weight and fat loss was conducted by researchers at the university of tennessee.\n",
      "thirty two obese adults were assigned to one of three reduced calorie diets kcal day below maintenance needs a low calcium control diet rag day containing little or dairy a diet adequate in calcium provided by calcium supplements rag day and a diet adequate in calcium provided by servings of milk cheese or yogurt rag day .\n",
      "after weeks subjects lost and lbs of  weight in the control calcium supplement and dairy diet group respectively.\n",
      "similar significance was observed for  fat loss with the greatest loss occurring in subjects on the dairy diet.\n",
      "these results provided the first direct human evidence indicating that increasing dietary calcium intake from low levels to recommended levels of intake can accelerate  weight and  fat loss in obese subjects when consuming a diet moderately reduced in calories.\n",
      "most important for the dairy  \n",
      "the intake of dairy foods had a substantially greater effect on both weight and fat loss compared to an equivalent amount of supplemental calcium.\n",
      "these findings have been confirmed by the tennessee researchers in two subsequent studies i.e. a week study in obese african americans and a week study using yogurt as the sole dairy food.\n",
      "these studies also discovered that subjects on high dairy diets lost significantly less lean  mass than those on low dairy calcium diets suggesting a favorable preservation of muscle during weight loss.\n",
      "three conditions common to these studies that may be important for demonstrating the favorable effects of adequate dairy calcium rag day on  weight and fat loss include a low baseline calcium intake of  day overweight and obese subjects and moderate caloric restriction kcals day .\n",
      "additional research is needed to verify the importance of these factors for dairy foods to accelerate weight fat loss.\n",
      "how does it work studies in human fat cells and experimental animals have suggested possible mechanisms whereby calcium dairy food intake may modulate energy and fat metabolism.\n",
      "briefly low calcium diets have been shown to increase the calcium regulating hormones calcitriol the active form of vitamin d and parathyroid hormone which increases calcium levels in fat cells.\n",
      "research suggests that intracellular calcium plays an important role in regulating fat metabolism by increasing fat storage and inhibiting fat breakdown in fat cells.\n",
      "conversely a high calcium diet inhibits the calcium regulating hormones thereby decreasing intracellular calcium which in turn decreases fat accumulation and increases the release of fat from fat cells.  \n",
      "of understanding the role of dairy foods in weight management a growing  of research has demonstrated that dairy products can help achieve a healthy weight.\n",
      "preliminary data from a recent human study that evaluated caloric expenditure in people given an adequate calcium diet provided by dairy foods\n",
      "has demonstrated significantly greater hour fat oxidation compared to a low calcium diet.\n",
      "other mechanisms that also may play a rote in reducing  weight and fat include greater fecal fat loss with higher calcium diets and or decreased food intake via satiety effects induced by dairy bioactive peptides.\n",
      "clearly additional research is needed in these areas to elucidate the mechanism s by which high calcium dairy food diets exert their effects on  composition.\n",
      "a  of science is rapidly emerging that supports a relationship between dairy food calcium consumption and effects on  weight and fat.\n",
      "clinical research in overweight and obese adults has found greater weight and fat loss with consumption of three servings of milk cheese or yogurt daily as part of a moderately reduced calorie diet and adequate in calcium versus a reduced calorie diet with little or dairy.\n",
