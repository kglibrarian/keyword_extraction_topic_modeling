      "Aggression is an instinctive drive of a person and a dark side of human nature1. It includes a variety of range of \n",
      "behaviors2. Aggression involves verbal and physical assault3, therefore, its expression results in intense violence \n",
      "towards others4. Aggression is an unwanted and maladaptive behavior causing damage and obliteration5. It is \n",
      "exhibited in different forms encompassing physical aggression, verbal aggression, anger and hostility6. A person \n",
      "with physical aggression causing physical and emotional harm others while harming or hurting someone verbally is \n",
      "described as verbal aggression. Anger involves physiological activation determining emotional and affective state. \n",
      "Hostility includes feelings of cynicism, mistrust and opposition. With regards to gender difference, research \n",
      "demonstrated men to be more involved in physical violence7. In contrast, women seemed to be more indulged in \n",
      "verbal aggression8. At times, women exhibit passive anger9.\n",
      "\n",
      "Substantial research data highlighted psychological and physical health problems with aggression. It is allied with \n",
      "depression and increased heart rate10,11. In women, anger is related to coronary heart disease12 while anger \n",
      "expression is connected to hypertension13. Aggression is related to physical health symptoms such as back pain, \n",
      "arthralgia, headaches and peptic ulcer14,15. Aggression is also harmful for social relationship with family and \n",
      "friends16. Anger has negative influence on physical health of women. It causes depression, disturbs quality of life \n",
      "and creates interpersonal problems17-19. The present research intended to examine the aggression as a \n",

      "experience discomfort, pain and feel incapable. Thus, it is significant to address factors determining their physical \n",

      "\n",
      "DISCUSSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Aggression significantly determines physical health of married women. Previous studies have also noted significant \n",
      "association between aggression8 and physical health such as coronary heart diseases21; thus supporting the \n",
      "present findings by exemplifying the negative influence of trait displaced aggression on physical health \n",
      "consequences22. Aggressive tendencies influence human physiology. People who face aggression physiologically \n",
      "respond to stressful situation with high activation of sympatho-adrenomedullary system23. That high activation of \n",
      "sympatho-adrenomedullary system is responsible for disturbance in blood flow, gastrointestinal and reproductive \n",
      "organs24. This might be one of the reasons, aggression affecting physical health in women. Anger, too, significantly \n",
      "determined physical health in married women. Literature has demonstrated significant association of anger with \n",
      "diabetes and coronary heart problems25.\n",
      "\n",
      "More anger out or anger expression was robustly associated with health risk behaviors and poor physical health26. \n",
      "In this regard, present findings could be justified while focusing on the emotions involved in anger. A previous study \n",
      "illustrated the direct influence of emotional state on physical health27. With negative emotions, an individual \n",
      "pessimistically perceive a problematic situation and easily gets frustrated. Conversely, optimistic point of view \n",
      "promotes physical health rather than impeding the person's growth. It was further revealed by other research \n",
      "evidence which proved optimism playing a significant predictive role in physical health28. Hence, women with anger \n",
      "and aggressiveness are preoccupied with negativity and pessimism leading to physical distress, discomfort and \n",
      "pain. Two other components of aggression(verbal aggression and hostility) did not significantly determine physical \n",
      "health in married women.\n",
      "\n",
      "Verbal aggression, in the present study, was also measured in the form of arguments and disagreements. Women \n",
      "are usually found to be using verbal ability to express whatever they feel and think. Sometimes, it results in verbal \n",
      "arguments, disagreements and illogical discussions. Perhaps for this reason, this variable might not be debilitating \n",
      "the physical health of women like physical aggression and anger did. Besides, hostility comprised of feelings of \n",
      "mistrust and cynicism also. Women, in the present study, might not feel their relations and life as miserable and \n",
      "mistrusted that could badly affect their physical health.\n",

      "CONCLUSION\n",
      "\n",
      "Verbal and physical aggression determines physical health of married women. Aggression cultivates negative \n",

section vol no length words byline asad r nadeem m christopher m ahmed h awais f and majeed h a body keywords awareness smokers non smokers oral health introduction the global tobacco epidemic is one of the serious and major public health concerns it causes more than eight million people deaths around the world of these fatalities seven million deaths are occurring due to direct consumption of tobacco while million mortalities of non smokers are the result of passive smoke owing to tobacco consumption low and middle income countries are the most vulnerable countries contributing to the highest morbidity and mortality rates where currently billion i e of the world s smokers resides in addition to the harmful effects of tobacco on health productivity losses and health expenditures are significantly contributing to the overall economic burden of smoking which is estimated to be around us trillion per annum this burden is equivalent to the magnitude of of the global annual gross domestic product gdp developing countries are the main stakeholders of this burden as they borne of this overall economic cost pakistan is among top countries who carries a substantial weight of diseases associated with tobacco worldwide according to the who report established scale of smoking frequency unveiled of pakistan s adult population of men and of women utilizes tobacco in various forms of the tobacco prevalent population of the adult population of men and of women are regular cigarette smokers whereas of the adult population men and women are regular water pipe smokers furthermore men women and of adults practice smokeless tobacco every day as concerns youth population of boys of girls and of youth is consuming tobacco in multiple ways many fatal diseases including respiratory diseases lung cancer and cardiovascular diseases are all directly associated with tobacco consumption similarly smoking is more likely to affect the oral well being in several ways emerging from nominal impacts e g teeth discoloring to plausibly hazardous conditions such as oral cancer other conditions include periodontal diseases diminished response to surgical as well as non surgical periodontal treatments pre cancerous lesions and dental transplant collapse the rapid increase in the use of tobacco in pakistan is alarming regardless of confirmed adverse impacts of smoking on health especially on oral wellbeing only few studies assess the awareness of dental patients in the context of pakistan furthermore the dearth of available literature elucidated oral diseases as a center of the research and few has analyzed other aspects of oral wellbeing therefore the objectives of this study were to assess the awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients and to explore the impact of sociodemographics on patient s awareness of these effects page of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics methods the survey was approved by the ethical review committee erc of the hussain college of health sciences hussain memorial hospital lahore no hcsc erc this analytical study was conducted for months between april and february in the six private dental clinics of lahore which is provincial capital of punjab pakistan all patients participated in this study provided written informed consent therefore all patients included in this survey were eighteen years of age or older and visiting for dental procedures in the private dental clinics however study excluded all those patients who did not provide written informed consent the minimum sample size needed to maintain a margin of error confidence interval was calculated as patients using a raosoft sample size calculator by using random sampling technique patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited for the study targeted patients were interviewed by the trained data enumerators by using semi structured questionnaires questionnaire was developed by a multi disciplinary team of authors based on the past reliable and validated scales the survey instrument was pre tested on two groups of patients each to assess various aspects including presentation acceptability and ease of understanding the questionnaire consisted of thirteen questions and was further sub divided into two sections the section wise distribution of variables information is as follows i sociodemographic variables included six questions i e gender female male age of the patient in years marital status single married education in years later transformed into dummy variable high school or less university education average household income in years later transformed into dummy variable pkr or below above pkr and rural background yes no ii smoking status of the dental patients and awareness regarding effects of smoking on oral health including seven questions i e current smoking status smoker non smoker smoking and oral health is related yes no smoking effects on oral well being including tooth staining yes no periodontal health yes no caries yes no wound healing yes no and oral cancer yes no scores were calculated for the patient s awareness by assigning yes and no for five effects of smoking on oral health i e periodontal health caries wound healing oral cancer and tooth staining and adding up these scores later data was analyzed using statistical package for social sciences software version ibm corp armonk ny usa frequencies percentages and measures of central tendency were calculated for the data differences between non smokers and smokers were assessed regarding patient s socio demographic factors and awareness using chi square test finally multiple linear regression analysis was used to analyze the impact of sociodemographic factors on the patient s awareness regarding the effects of

visiting private clinics table discussion smokers were least aware of the adverse impact of smoking on oral health than non smokers scores calculated for the level of awareness unveiled great variations among patients regarding the identification of adverse impacts on oral health triggered by smoking as most of the patients were only able to identify two or threeout of five effects moreover smoker versus non smoker patients were significantly different according to their education gender and rural background also awareness level for the different effects of smoking on oral health including periodontal health caries oral cancer and wound healing was significantly different in smokers versus non smokers furthermore socio demographic factors i e income education and gender were significantly impacting the patient s awareness in current study our results regarding patient s awareness related to negative impact of smoking on oral health among smokers were consistent from those reported by researchers in kuwait the study showed that only one fourth dental patients had full knowledge of these effects similarly dawood and colleagues also reported that smokers had lack of awareness for such effects including male impotency in smokers lung cancers in passive smokers it might be owing to the addiction to smoking which force the smokers to stick with the tobacco consumption irrespective of its hazardous effects on general health and oral wellbeing this justification may also be related to the government of pakistan s initiative which has ensured the compliance of cigarette manufacturers to mention the cautions of smoking hazards on each page of impact of socio demographic factors on awareness of smoking effects on oral health among smokers and non smokers dental patients visiting private clinics and every pack of cigarette in written and pictorial form on the contrary a non smoker perspective may also be inferred which indicates that lack of smoking is directly associated with the awareness of smoking hazards another reason may also be supplemented according to which non smokers being well aware of smoking effects intends to avoid such addictions so they may not encountered with fatal diseases consistent with our work bhatti and colleagues showed that none of the female patients were consuming tobacco in any form as compare to their male counterparts another study elucidated that female as compare to male patients were taking good care of themselves in chronic ill health conditions which shows the female s priority to maintain their health and well being another reason might be linked which explained the gender differences for tobacco consumption is due to the cultural restrictions where such practices consider as unpleasant especially for women contrary to our results a us based study reported that prevalence of smoking among university graduates was less as compared to those having education up to high school level in consistent its present study results sociodemographics including education gender and income were associated with the awareness level of patients regarding smoking hazards to oral health study further showed that females as well as people having higher level of education and higher income were more likely to be aware of such hazards according to a who report smoking is directly linked with the low socioeconomic communities people with low income tend to smoke more than their affluent counterpart and smoking worsened the level of poverty nevertheless our study results didn t support such associations but consistent to saudi study which showed that individuals from affluent families were more likely to smoke cigarettes as compare to those with low socioeconomic backgrounds the argument of economic disadvantage deems to provide an explanation that having lower probability of smoking among unprivileged individuals might be owing to their unaffordability to purchase cigarettes than people from higher income class it is concluded that in a nutshell smoker patients are least aware of the harmful effects of smoking on oral health than non smokers patient awareness concerning such effects is affected by various sociodemographics therefore there is a dire need of further comparative studies involving public healthcare facilities to ensure the validity of inferences drawn from this study limitations the study was self funded and has limited resources in future study may be conducted on large scale to strengthen its reliability of conclusions drawn about study topic

use behaviors are influenced by familial patterns and neighborhood factors this work explored the influence of individual family and environment on alcohol use baseline data from a randomized controlled trial with black mothers son dyads n¼ were paired with census tract and alcohol control board data among mothers younger age along with neighborhood factors of alcohol outlet density race and education were significantly associated with use among sons older age and alcohol outlet density in the neighborhood predicted use findings highlight neighborhood influence beyond family qualities as a significant determinant of disadvantaged black mothers alcohol use implications for public health policy are discussed elsevier ltd all rights reserved introduction social determinants of health at the family and neighborhood levels are well known influences on health behaviors u s department of health and human services alcohol use behaviors are influenced by familial patterns of communication and role modeling and contextual neighborhood factors such as poverty density housing status and alcohol outlet density luk et al resko et al theall et al the goal of this study was to use individual family and neighborhood variables in conjunction with gis analysis to explore alcohol use from an ecological perspective although previous studies have undertaken such methods to examine alcohol density and use livingston et al popova et al none has explored factors at the individual familial and environmental levels using data from both parents and children this study addressed that gap in the literature by exploring the influence of individual intrafamilial and environmental factors on alcohol use among black mothers and sons living in public housing communities influence of family on adolescent alcohol use parenting factors have been found to contribute to alcohol use among adolescents parent child communication has been cited as a significant factor in adolescent alcohol use behavior although the directionality of these outcomes has been questioned luk et al martyn et al miller day and kam song et al this inconsistency may indicate that other family processes serve as protective mechanisms against adolescent alcohol use family qualities shown to influence alcohol use include parent child relationship quality kuendig and kuntsche parental role modeling latendresse et al and monitoring kuntsche et al the only study examining the effects of family factors and proximity to alcohol outlets on adolescent alcohol use found that although proximity to alcohol outlets was associated with alcohol use consistent parenting reduced the risk of alcohol use by nearly west et al influence of neighborhood on alcohol use neighborhood geographic variables have been repeatedly noted as predictors of adult alcohol use with neighborhood disadvantage usually measured as the cumulative effect of four census variables percentage of residents living below the poverty line percentage of woman headed households unemployment contents lists available at sciencedirect journal homepage health place elsevier ltd all rights reserved n corresponding author tel þ fax þ e mail address j a cederbaum health place rate and percentage of families receiving public assistance boardman et al theorists e g gruenewald scribner et al also note that alcohol outlets are associated with alcohol use and related problems as noted by gruenewald alcohol outlets are more often found in areas where rents are lower creating a higher concentration of alcohol outlets in low income areas gorman and speer this has been shown to contribute to increase public health issues among already vulnerable populations including increases in child abuse freisther et al partner violence cunradi et al livingston mckinney et al and gun violence branas et al grubesic et al alcohol outlet density has also been shown to contribute to alcohol use but less consistently although some studies found that the number of alcohol outlets in close proximity to an individual s residence was associated with alcohol use and heavy drinking scribner et al weitzman et al particularly among women theall et al factors other than outlet density were more significant predictors picone et al pollack et al type of outlet on site such as a bar vs off site such as a liquor store was also related to problem drinking with on site sales being more predictive of excessive alcohol consumption truong and sturm findings regarding the effect of neighborhood qualities on adolescent alcohol use have been mixed although attributes of neighborhoods and schools have been significantly related to early initiation of alcohol use contrary to expectations higher rates of lifetime alcohol use were found among both youths and adults in neighborhoods that offered more social advantages kuntsche et al in one study the perception of restaurant and bar density in an adolescent s community was related to alcohol consumption kuntsche et al yet another study found no association between perceptions of the density of liquor stores or other off premise alcohol outlets and consumption truong and sturm additionally perceived neighborhood disorder was related to adolescent alcohol tobacco and marijuana use ennett et al as such ecological studies of alcohol outlets are of fundamental importance gruenewald this work approaches the work from an ecological approach considering the individual parent and community level influences on alcohol use among black adolescent boys purpose while researchers have noted the influence of alcohol outlet density on a number of serious public health issues e g violence there has been a dearth of research exploring multilevel influences on adolescent alcohol use and no study has used primary data from both parents and children alongside neighborhood level factors collected through administrative data to explore this issue therefore the specific aims of this study were to examine individual factors associated with alcohol use among black ado lescent mothers and sons ages residing in public housing communities explore the influence of family factors i e mother son alcohol communication maternal alcohol use role modeling monitoring and mother son relationship on sons alcohol use and examine the distribution of alcohol outlets throughout the city of philadelphia and how alcohol outlet density is associated with adult and adolescent alcohol use we hypothe sized that older sons and those living in a one parent home would be more likely to report drinking alcohol parental monitoring would be associated with less reported alcohol con sumption among sons and higher alcohol outlet density and lower neighborhood education would be associated with alcohol use among both mothers and sons this study was unique in several ways first because the sample participants were mother and son dyads we were able to explore their behaviors at the individual and dyadic level allowing us to test the social ecological model bronfenbrenner second this sample was distinct from the general popula tion in that it consisted of individuals with disadvantaged race and ethnicity and socioeconomic status all participants self identified as black and resided in public housing communities results from this study have implications for community planning and policies regarding prevention of alcohol use in government assisted hous ing communities and prevention at the dyadic level methods study design this work is an analysis of data from a randomized control trial rct and administrative sources the rct evaluated the effectiveness of a peer delivered hiv risk reduction intervention the original study included black mothers who resided in public housing communities in philadelphia pa and her adolescent son years of age mothers were recruited through lists of women generated by the philadelphia housing authority for each of the public housing communities women were selected at random from each housing community and invited to participate health promotion intervention if potential participants did not have telephones the site coordinator went door to door to extend an invitation to enroll both the mother and her son had to agree to participate if the mother had more than one son between and years old living with her the oldest son was invited to participate consent assent was obtained prior to enrollment once enrolled mothers were randomly assigned to either a hiv risk reduction condition or control condition in which they received a general health promotion intervention to reduce their and their son s risk of behavior linked diseases including tobacco alcohol and drug use and to promote exercise and healthy eating the interventions led by specially trained black facilitators from the housing developments were structurally similar all data were collected via self administered survey mothers and sons were not seated together during survey completion and both were encour aged to provide honest answers no data was shared between the dyad institutional review board approval was provided by the university of pennsylvania for the original study and university of southern california for the secondary analyses in the current study we used baseline data to explore associa tions between individual familial and environmental factors and adolescent alcohol use of the mother son dyads from whom data was collected all mothers participated in the intervention we included participants from housing communities partici pants who resided in scatter site public housing were not included in the geographic analysis because their exact address could not be confirmed n¼ dyads leaving us with a final sample size of dyads for these analyses bivariate analyses revealed no statistical differences in demographic variables when comparing scatter site residents to housing community residents except housing community resident mothers were twice as likely to be employed or¼ po and half as likely to have less than a high school education or¼ po the final sample for this work consisted of dyads administrative census data from middle of study years and alcohol outlet data from complemented the rct baseline data participants data for these analyses were provided by black mothers and their sons who resided in public housing communities in philadelphia pa the average age of mothers was years and the average age of sons was slightly less than years see table twenty eight percent of j a cederbaum et al health place mothers had less than a high school education were employed thirty percent reported residing with a man in the home regarding alcohol use of mothers and of sons reported having ever used alcohol and of mothers and of sons reported alcohol use during the previous days dependent variable the primary dependent variable was sons lifetime and mothers current alcohol use mothers and sons were asked parallel single item measures have you ever drunk alcohol yes or no and in the past month days on how many days did you drink alcohol beer wine wine coolers malt liquor and hard liquor response choices for the second question were i have never drunk alcohol i did not drink any alcohol in the past month day days to days to days and or more days after evaluating response distribution the measure was recoded to reflect having drunk alcohol on or more days during the previous month although these were brief measures the use of single item measures has been successful in prior substance use assessments flewelling and bauman seale et al wilson et al individual and family variables individual level variables included age and mothers current employment the family level variable included in the models for mothers was living with a man in the home in the sons models along with the aforementioned variables mothers recent alcohol use and parental monitoring were included parental monitoring was a measure of maternal strictness rated using an item scale used in previous studies jemmott and jemmott williams and vinson examples of questions included how strict are you about your son being home by a certain hour going to his friends homes having company and letting your son do thing his friends are doing responses ranged from ¼not strict at all to ¼very strict the items were summed to create a score ranging from to internal reliability in this dataset was acceptable devellis at α¼ geographic data sources philadelphia

black population since buffer boundaries did not coincide with census block group boundaries different gis tools intersect dissolve calculate field were applied to calculate the proportion of the census block groups that fell within each of the buffers then the proportions were applied to the demographic data and the various numbers summed for each buffer later the percentage of black population households with incomes below the federal poverty threshold and percentage of population with less than a high school diploma were calculated geographic and statistical analysis the analysis occurred in multiple steps first using a geopro cessing tool a boundary was created for each dyad s address and the number of alcohol distribution outlets located within each table

education man currently lives in home j a cederbaum et al health place zone was calculated given that an individual could live at the border of a census tract making a tract a less specific measure ment of distance and density a m distance was chosen based on research by austin et al indicating that the average adult can walk m in min a series of network buffers calculating m distances along the street network was cre ated around each dyad address using the arcgis service area tools in the network analysis extension the road network data that were used was the tiger line data file from the u s census bureau then the number of alcohol outlet inside each network buffer was calculated the density of alcohol outlet was created by dividing number of alcohol outlet inside network buffer to area of those network buffers displayed in fig weighted population census data were then linked to each dyad according to the census block group in which their address was located this was deter mined to be the most accurate depiction of each dyad s neighbor hood environment because census tracts are highly localized the new variables alcohol outlet per m radius density and census variables were then merged with the original dataset in spss v bivariate correlations were calculated between the outlet density and census variables to determine whether geo graphic variables were related univariable logistic regressions were used to individually test associations of each independent variable with the two outcome variables because this sample was naturally clustered dyads and housing clustering we assessed interclass correlation icc although the result was statistically significant po the clustering only explained of the variance in the data when the icc was added to the models no changes in outcome were observed we further explored ways in which variables may influence one another through the creation of three interaction variables out let density and maternal monitoring behavior outlet density and maternal alcohol use and maternal alcohol use and maternal monitoring behavior effects of interaction variables were not statistically significant and not included in final models multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to test pre dictors of mothers recent alcohol use and sons lifetime alcohol use sons lifetime use was chosen as the outcome variable rather than use during the previous days due to the infrequency of sons reports of recent alcohol use variables were entered in three blocks individual variables family variables and environmental variables results descriptive statistics are shown in table on average there were outlets sd¼ per m radius surrounding dyad addresses on average of the surrounding population was had not graduated high school

alcohol by sons increased by alcohol outlet density also increased the odds of sons lifetime use by po no family variable man living in the home parental monitoring or recent maternal alcohol use or demographic environmental vari ables were associated with sons reported alcohol use discussion this study was the first to our knowledge to use individual intrafamilial and environmental data from mother son dyads to explore the influence of multiple systems on the alcohol use of mothers and sons in public housing communities although previous studies have merged individual and environmental data to explore alcohol use austin et al picone et al pollack et al theall et al truong and sturm only one identified study included any family factors and none included dyadic data west et al these findings suggest that despite their modest effect relative to other risk factors using individual level data collected from black mothers and sons can increase our understanding of the influence of multiple systems on alcohol use in this study the only individual level variable associated with either mothers or sons alcohol use was age although younger mothers were slightly more likely to report drinking alcohol use among sons was more common among older adolescents these findings are in line with prior research that showed that as adults age they are less likely to report drinking schiller et al and that as adolescents age they are more likely to report drinking center for disease control contrary to our hypothesis none of the family variables man living in the home parental monitoring mothers recent alcohol use was associated with adolescent sons alcohol use several factors may have contributed to these nonsignificant findings although parental presence in the home has been found to be associated with more monitoring and less frequent substance use among adolescents borawski et al eaton et al living in a home with an adult man was not associated with reduced or increased substance use among adolescent boys this finding in these data may be related in part to issues of statistical power only one third of boys reported ever drinking and only one third of the sample reported a man living in the home however we were unable to determine the relation ship of these male figures to each mother son dyad and whether qualitative differences exist between having a biological father in the home compared to another man our finding that parental monitoring was not associated with adolescent alcohol use is in contrast to other studies capaldi et al fosco et al resnick et al ryan et al the lack of association between monitoring and behavior may be partially explained by the lack of variance in the sample or lack of power reliability was acceptable but not high it may also be reflective of prior research that has noted that high parental control is a strategy among black mothers dodge et al tobler and komro with mothers of boys potentially more controlling than those of girls jackson finally the lack of association between maternal and sons alcohol use is also incon sistent with previous findings tamis lemonda et al the temporal incongruence recent use by mothers and lifetime use by sons may have contributed to this nonsignificant finding further neighborhood factors may be inherently more predictive of these behaviors when adolescents are living in high risk settings poverty educational attainment and race have been associated with increased alcohol accessibility hurd et al we found that environmental variables were associated with substance use by both mothers and sons however the factors that affected each member of a dyad were not the same despite inconsistent findings regarding the influence of alcohol accessibility on use picone et al pollack et al truong and sturm our findings supported results from previous work indicating that accessibility is significantly related to alcohol use scribner et al theall et al weitzman et al while age was an important predictor of alcohol use for both mothers and sons and not intrafamilial factors influenced either only mothers were influenced by neighborhood variables percent of high school graduates and percent black however both mothers and sons alcohol use was influenced by density of outlets near housing communities similar to findings from previous studies pollack et al

families below poverty nnn nnn po j a cederbaum et al health place density was associated with alcohol use the percentage of black residents and residents who had not graduated high school in each census block group predicted alcohol use by mothers although it has been noted that perceived neighborhood disorder including poverty level is associated with alcohol use boardman et al ennett et al this was not the case in our study given the high correlation between education and poverty in our data it may be that living in these neighborhoods contributed to increased stress which in turn contributed to alcohol use by mothers berke et al finally although previous studies indicated that alcohol use is higher among adolescents and adults in affluent neighborhoods pollack et al truong and sturm the increased availability of alcohol in neighborhoods with a higher percentage of black residents may influence the associa tion found in the current study brenner et al romley et al tamis lemonda et al limitations although these unique dyadic data allowed the exploration of alcohol use among mothers and sons on individual intrafamilial and environmental levels there were several limitations to the current study first although we were able to capture data from multiple sources we did not have any information on peer use of alcohol future studies should examine how peer networks and alcohol availability relate to adolescent alcohol use second sampling affected the variation of neighborhood environments individuals living in the same housing site shared the same neighborhood characteristics future studies might explore the aggregate behaviors of individuals living in the same housing site to determine how housing not just the home environment is related to alcohol use behaviors further although we did not have the power to do so examining recent alcohol use among adoles cent boys and how it is influenced by individual intrafamilial and environmental factors should be a feature of future research although these data were rich in measures lower r values for models indicated that there were missing factors that explained some of the variation in alcohol use for both mothers and sons further research should test other contributing variables and mediating and moderating variables last there is the possibility that answers provided by participants were influenced by the desire to provide socially desirable answers to promote honesty data collectors had mothers and sons complete the survey simul taneously but separately and provided reminders about data confidentiality conclusion overall study findings imply that assessment of neighborhood affluence or disadvantage can inform local governing entities regarding community planning and licensing policies related to alcohol outlets for example this study s findings highlight neigh borhood influence above family qualities as a determinant of disadvantaged black mothers alcohol use indeed the finding that mothers living in areas with higher alcohol availability were more likely to drink suggests that policies need to be place to address table mother recent alcohol use þdays of

high risk environments can potentially affect parenting capacity and monitoring as alcohol outlets are more likely to be located in lower income areas gorman and speer one primary prevention opportunity is influencing policy to reduce the number of alcohol outlets located in already vulnerable areas secondary and tertiary prevention strategies such as instal ling alcohol use informational billboards or developing school based programs intervention programs can be implemented in existing high alcohol density and low income housing commu nities or communities with similar risk
